    <p>For reasons not relevant to this blog, I have been thinking a lot lately about personal conflicts and how they evolve. In particular, my mind has been concentrating a great deal on the scenario of conflicts <em>escalating</em>: for example, the phenomenon where two people are having a regular conversation, and this somehow leads to a disagreement, and eventually the situation develops into an all-out shouting match with both parties so angry with each other that it’s often baffling to recall how the conversation began.</p>

<p>This can happen over a short or a long period of <strong>time</strong>. It can take place within a single ten-minute conversation; it can also span days, months, even <em>years</em> (in this case it might be the cause of a friendship’s disintegration). It can also occur on a small or large <strong>scale</strong>. It might occur between friends, families, communities, even <em>nations</em> (throughout history, what war has not started as a smaller disagreement that eventually grew to something much larger?). I think we’ve all seen it happen, sadly, probably numerous times.</p>

<p>As I am a software developer, I often perceive parallels between <em>real-world phenomena</em> and <em>software concepts</em>. What I want to do right now is to discuss one such parallel: the similarity between <strong>escalating conflict</strong> (the real-world phenomenon) and <strong>mutual recursion</strong> (the software concept).</p>

<p><strong>A note to those readers who aren’t programmers: I will be including some source code in this post, but don’t stop reading! I promise that this discussion is of a general nature and not strictly programming-related.</strong></p>

<p>For those who can read it, consider the following code snippet:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Provoke</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Provoke!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">Respond</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Respond</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Respond!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">Provoke</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If I were to ask you, <em>What does the above code do?</em>, an initial response might be that <span class="post-link">... (<a href="/posts/terminating-condition.html">read the full post</a>)</span></p>
