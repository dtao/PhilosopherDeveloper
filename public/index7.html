    <p>For reasons not relevant to this blog, I have been thinking a lot lately about personal conflicts and how they evolve. In particular, my mind has been concentrating a great deal on the scenario of conflicts <em>escalating</em>: for example, the phenomenon where two people are having a regular conversation, and this somehow leads to a disagreement, and eventually the situation develops into an all-out shouting match with both parties so angry with each other that it’s often baffling to recall how the conversation began.</p>

<p>This can happen over a short or a long period of <strong>time</strong>. It can take place within a single ten-minute conversation; it can also span days, months, even <em>years</em> (in this case it might be the cause of a friendship’s disintegration). It can also occur on a small or large <strong>scale</strong>. It might occur between friends, families, communities, even <em>nations</em> (throughout history, what war has not started as a smaller disagreement that eventually grew to something much larger?). I think we’ve all seen it happen, sadly, probably numerous times.</p>

<p>As I am a software developer, I often perceive parallels between <em>real-world phenomena</em> and <em>software concepts</em>. What I want to do right now is to discuss one such parallel: the similarity between <strong>escalating conflict</strong> (the real-world phenomenon) and <strong>mutual recursion</strong> (the software concept).</p>

<p><strong>A note to those readers who aren’t programmers: I will be including some source code in this post, but don’t stop reading! I promise that this discussion is of a general nature and not strictly programming-related.</strong></p>

<p>For those who can read it, consider the following code snippet:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Provoke</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Provoke!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">Respond</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Respond</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Respond!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">Provoke</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If I were to ask you, <em>What does the above code do?</em>, an initial response might be that <span class="post-link">... (<a href="/posts/terminating-condition.html">read the full post</a>)</span></p>

    <p>I hope everyone had a joyful time last night—but not <em>too</em> joyful, of course. I myself attended a party where the man who owned the house was showing everyone in attendance this M.C. Escher painting and asking him to name the <em>first</em> thing he saw:</p>

<figure><img src="/images/white-angels-and-black-devils.jpg" alt="Who doesnt see the devils first?"><figcaption>Who doesnt see the devils first?</figcaption></figure>

<p>Basically, everyone said “bats” (apparently they’re devils?). The man would then pull the picture away, say “Now look between the bats,” and show the picture again. On the second look, viewers would see the angels.</p>

<p>My big issue with this was: is this really so surprising? In our culture, by <em>default</em> white is a “background” color; just think of every single book you’ve ever read. The <em>pages</em> are white; the <em>text</em> (the <em>content</em>) is black. Or consider any black &amp; white picture. Is white not virtually <em>always</em> the background, with black representing the content? Our eyes are drawn—whether by nature or simply by convention, I can’t say, but drawn nevertheless—to the black part of a black &amp; white visual.</p>

<p>So I, personally, didn’t think it was that surprising. But I think it’s a really cool picture, just like everything else by Escher; and I’m glad the guy at the party was showing it to people.</p>

<p>That’s not what I wanted to write about today at all, though. Perhaps I’ll write another post soon to discuss what I originally meant to discuss in this one: an interesting realization I recently had, and how it relates to my New Year’s resolution.</p>
