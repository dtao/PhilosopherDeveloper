    <p>I bet you weren’t expecting any sane developer to make this argument!</p>

<p>Well, to be fair, the title of this post is somewhat intentionally provocative. But anyway, you’re here now; so it served its purpose. And make no mistake: I <em>am</em> going to defend global state—just possibly not in quite the way you might be expecting.</p>

<h2 id="what_we_mean_by_global_state_1">What we mean by global state</h2>

<p>First, some background. If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you’re a developer so I probably don’t have to explain this; but I think there are at least two forms of <strong>global state</strong> that come to mind in software. One form is global <strong>variables</strong>–values that are accessible and can be changed, globally, anywhere, by all of the code in a project. The other is <strong>constants</strong>–values that may be <em>accessible</em> to potentially every part of a program, but cannot be changed.</p>

<p>These aren’t the only kinds of global state, though. I would argue that <em>globality</em>–apparently that’s <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/globality">actually a word</a>–is a <em>continuous</em> (as opposed to discrete or binary) property. Meaning: it isn’t just variables and constants; there are things in between as well. There are some values that will <em>definitely</em> change (e.g., a global cache), there are some that <em>might</em> (e.g., a feature flag), others that probably won’t (static configuration values), and so on. There is also the question of a variable’s <em>impact</em>, which is not the same as its <em>scope</em>, or how widely it happens to be accessible. One bit of state might define the language or dialect in which an entire UI is presented, for example, while another may simply indicate whether or not to display a certain dialog when an application loads.</p>

<p>So there’s some sort of spectrum here (you know <a href="/posts/am-i-an-engineer.html">how I like spectrums</a>), or<span class="post-link">... (<a href="/posts/in-defense-of-global-state.html">read the full post</a>)</span></p>

    <p>I never actually worked in an environment like this, but I’ve read enough articles on <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">The Daily WTF</a> to have an image in my head of the old dusty, temperamental servers that companies used to have back in the 90s and early 2000s.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/ye-olde-server.jpg" alt="Ye olde server"><figcaption>Ye olde server</figcaption></figure>

<p>Those were dark days, from what I hear—when your business was victimized at the whim of an unpredictable piece of hardware. If the power went out, or the CPU overheated, or the hard drive failed, your site went down. It was as simple as that.</p>

<p>We live in a different era now, with PaaS and IaaS and all that cloudy good stuff. Your average tech-savvy business owner is going to know there’s no particularly good reason to run your own server anymore if you’re a small company. And if you’re one of the large companies providing these services like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google</a>, you have been on top of the hardware problem for a long time, with data centers distributed around the country (or the world) connected in a controllable and reliable way. It’s not an issue anymore.</p>

<p>This is a dream come true for everyone at the top of the food chain. The last thing you want in a high-up role is to be embarrassed by a problem at the bottom, far below eye level. The infrastructures that exist now for tech companies abstract servers into basically a sea of computing potential, which can be drawn from, predictably, as needed. (And on those rare occasions when outages <em>do</em> occur, it’s still nothing to lose sleep over. It’s Amazon’s problem; they’ll deal with it and apologize profusely in the morning.)</p>

    <p>A few years ago my parents gave me and my wife this knife as a Christmas present:</p>

<figure><img src="/images/shun-utility-knife.jpg" alt="The Shun Classic Utility Knife"><figcaption>The Shun Classic Utility Knife</figcaption></figure>

<p>We weren’t quite sure what to make of it at first, but it wasn’t long before we both loved it. It is a <em>very</em> sharp knife, which makes it a breeze to cut through just about anything. Unfortunately, that <em>anything</em> includes human flesh. I know this because a few months after receiving the knife I was cutting an avocado and the knife slipped in my hand. It was quite a bad cut.</p>

<p>Obviously—I still have all ten fingers—my wound healed eventually. But I do have a pretty clear memory of the incident, which makes me quite fearful of repeating it. Here are two ways I could protect myself from future self-inflicted injury:</p>

<ol>
<li>Decide <strong>the knife is too sharp</strong>. I could replace the Shun knife with a duller one, so that if my hand ever slips while cutting again the injury won’t be so bad.</li>

<li>Decide <strong>I wasn’t careful enough</strong>. In the future I could cut more slowly and be very cautious whenever I’m using the knife.</li>
</ol><p>I believe these are the same two options many developers choose between when building software.</p>

<p>In the first camp, you have the mentality that our tools must be safe and protect us from harm. This is a classic reason to prefer statically typed languages like Java or C#: the compiler can tell me when I’ve done something wrong! A significant number of potential bugs are eliminated before human consideration even enters the picture. This makes it nearly impossible to actually ship code with boneheaded mistakes like typos, syntax errors, etc.</p>

<p>In the second camp, there’s the philosophy that we must practice restraint in our development efforts. Teams with this attitude may use dynamic languages like<span class="post-link">... (<a href="/posts/risk-aversion-and-software-development.html">read the full post</a>)</span></p>

    <p>In a footnote to <a href="/posts/making-yaml-safe-again.html">my post a while ago on SafeYAML</a>, I established a goal of writing more about my many open source projects, which I have a bad habit of not telling anyone about—sometimes even long after they’re finished!</p>

<p>So today I want to write about a pretty good one that’s relatively polished and full-featured. It’s called <a href="http://dtao.github.io/HighTables/">HighTables</a>, and it’s a JavaScript library that makes adding charts to existing sites with HTML tables <em>extremely</em> easy.</p>

<p>Here, I’ll give you an example (<strong>note</strong>: this is probably not going to display properly for those of you on RSS readers; <a href="http://philosopherdeveloper.com/posts/charts-made-dead-simple-with-hightables.html">visit the website</a> to see what I’m trying to show you!):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;table</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"render-to-bar-chart"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;th&gt;</span>Method of rendering a chart<span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;th&gt;</span>How easy it is (scale from 1 to 10)<span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Using Highcharts directly<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>3<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Using HighTables<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>10<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/table&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And the result:</p>
<table class="render-to-bar-chart">
<tr>
<th>Method of rendering a chart</th>
    <th>How easy it is (scale from 1 to 10)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Using Highcharts directly</td>
    <td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Using HighTables</td>
    <td>10</td>
</tr>
</table><p>Pretty cool, right?</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, HighTables itself isn’t all that complicated. It leverages the power of two existing libraries, <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. If you don’t know about Highcharts, it’s a great library that lets you render all kinds of charts (line, area, bar, pie, etc.) in JavaScript. And if you don’t know about jQuery, and you’re a JavaScript developer, you should probably blow the dust off your keyboard and <a href="http://www.doxdesk.com/img/updates/20091116-so-large.gif">ask any JS-related question on the internet</a> to learn more about it.</p>

<p>My problem with Highcharts in the past was that it has <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts">a <em>behemoth</em> API</a>. Rendering a chart was never a simple matter of calling <code>pieChart()</code>; instead, any chart-creation logic requires a whole ton of options that an average person is very unlikely to remember from one<span class="post-link">...

    <p>Most people outside of the software development profession (and even many on the inside) may not realize that there is some disagreement within the community as to whether or not software development is a form of <em>engineering</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s say you placed software developers along a spectrum, where at one end “engineering” might as well be a foreign word, and at the other end writing software is <em>obviously</em> a form of engineering, in much the same way that painting or sculpture is obviously a form of art.</p>

<figure class="plain"><img src="/images/engineering-spectrum.png" alt="Is software development a form of engineering?"><figcaption>Is software development a form of engineering?</figcaption></figure>

<p>Personally, I have worked at various points along this spectrum. My first developer job was at a trading company in Philadelphia, which would have fallen pretty close to the extreme left end. At <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> I would say the culture was somewhere in the middle, with plenty of developers leaning in both directions (I definitely worked with self-professed “engineers” at ThoughtWorks, as well as individuals who vehemently rejected the label).</p>

<p>More recently I’ve worked in environments that fall much closer to the right side of the spectrum. The culture at <a href="http://www.cardpool.com">Cardpool</a>–founded by two former Microsoft employees and with its first two hires from Google—was, not surprisingly, firmly in the software-as-engineering camp. I would expect no different from most large software companies (or developers with large company roots). And a couple of weeks ago I started at Google myself, which I’m guessing will be about as far to the right as I’ll ever get in my career.</p>

<p>(By the way, it’s probably not a coincidence that I chose to assign the left and right sides of the spectrum to the viewpoints that I did; read <a href="https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz">Steve Yegge’s argument</a> that software developers fall into “liberal” and “conservative” groups to get an interesting view on a related subject.
