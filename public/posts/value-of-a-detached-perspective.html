<p>Several months ago I was at a party where I wound up in a lengthy conversation with a guy named Chris, whose professional title is <em>resident neuromathematician</em>. Obviously, I was fascinated by his line of work and asked him a ton of questions about what he does. And probably as a result of our respective professions–neuroscience on one side, software engineering on the other–the discussion inevitably veered into the topic of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Something I found pretty shocking about Chris’s perspective was a claim he made about how <em>far</em> we are from being able to replicate, in any satisfactory sense, the capabilities of a human brain.</p>

<p>Now, don’t get me wrong; I have a tremendous amount of respect for what the brain does. It seems to me an almost unfathomably complex thing (I hesitate to call it a “machine” as that would imply a more opinionated viewpoint than I actually hold), and I don’t doubt that the closest thing we have in the technological world today–i.e., the computer–doesn’t even come close to matching it.</p>

<p>That said, I was still shocked by what Chris said: he asserted that we are <strong>at least 10,000 years away</strong> from being able to do with computers what the brain can do now.</p>

<p>The only way I can describe my response to that claim is: I’m skeptical.</p>

<p>Why am I skeptical? Am I familiar with the latest research in neuroscience, neurobiology, neuromathematics, etc.? Of course not. What about the latest in A.I.? Truthfully, not that either. So how do I even manage to have an opinion on the subject?</p>

<p>As an example of how primitive our best attempts at advanced A.I. are right now–and he provided quite a few–Chris waved his hand rapidly through the air, dodging my head, the cup I was holding, his own cup, and several other obstacles in the immediate area. He pointed out that this was extremely easy for him to do, and that he wasn’t even actively thinking about the path his hand was following. More impressive still, he observed that when we walk through crowds of people, we are generally able to weave through an arbitrary number of moving targets–<em>all</em> of us <em>actively avoiding one another</em>–again, without any conscious thought. He then explained that from a mathematical perspective, these types of problems are so extraordinarily complex as to be totally beyond reach with current software.</p>

<p>The more Chris talked about what the brain can do, that modern software simply can’t, the more I felt a sense of awe at what our brains are capable of. Yet I remained no less suspicious of Chris’s original claim about 10,000 years. And ultimately, it dawned on me that my skepticism was actually <em>increasing</em> the more he supported his argument with details from his research.</p>

<p>The way I see the issue, Chris was <strong>too intimately familiar with the details</strong> of the problem to have a reasonable sense of the bigger picture. I, in contrast, have basically zero comprehension of how the brain works; but as a result I am able to imagine scenarios that Chris has prematurely (in my opinion) discarded.</p>
