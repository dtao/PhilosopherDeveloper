    <p>I recently caught wind of an exciting new project that claims to be “the world’s smallest and fastest JavaScript library”: <a href="http://vaporjs.com/">Vapor.js</a>.</p>

<p>We developers are always excited about small &amp; fast libraries, so naturally I was intrigued. Taking a look at the project’s homepage, you immediately see the following tantalizing graph:</p>

<figure><img src="/images/vaporjs.jpg" alt="The worlds smallest &amp; fastest JavaScript library"><figcaption>The worlds smallest &amp; fastest JavaScript library</figcaption></figure>

<p>Wow. Now <em>that’s</em> fast (off the charts, <em>literally!</em>)… but wait a minute. How can this be? Let’s take a look at the source code…</p>

<p>On its GitHub page, the Vapor.js README file starts off as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>vapor.js is a new amazing JavaScript framework.</strong></p>

<p>In just 0 lines of code it provides:</p>

<p>[The README ends there.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah. <em>I</em> get it now. It’s a joke.</p>

<p>But you know what? I actually think there’s something to this. A couple of things, actually<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>First, there’s the “fastest” claim and that absurd graph. Obviously, if the library does <em>nothing</em>, it’s as “fast” as it can possibly get. But, you know, I say “obviously”; yet it’s very easy to forget this fundamental axiom:</p>

<p class="large">You make software <em>faster</em> by making it <em>do less</em>.</p>

<p>(This concept is clearly not original to me. I’m sure I’ve read an article or blog post specifically about this idea somewhere else; unfortunately, I was not able to find a reference with a quick Google search.)</p>

<p>CPUs aren’t creatures; you can’t magically make them perform more operations per second by cracking a whip or digging in your spurs (although <em>like</em> many animals, they <em>can</em> be sped up by reducing their load). Your processor is a <strong>machine</strong>, executing instructions at a (basically) constant rate. It’s the <strong>number of instructions</strong> that affects how “fast” or “slow” your software feels.</p>

<p>Note that I am not just talking about <em>features</em>. The same feature can be implemented in countless ways, some requiring far more <em>processing</em> than others. For a trivial example, consider sorting a sequence. There’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Bubble Sort</a>, one of the most famously (or infamously) inefficient algorithms known to computer science; and then there are vastly superior algorithms like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">Merge Sort</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Quicksort</a>—one of the most <em>efficient</em> algorithms (for sorting) known—or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_sort">Comb Sort</a>, which is basically Bubble Sort after getting its act together. Same feature, different implementations.</p>

<p>But the other point this brought to my mind is not performance-related. It has to do with quality and productivity. Far too often, software projects become burdened with external dependencies: frameworks, libraries, tools, all piled on atop one other so liberally that it can quickly become very difficult to keep track of all of them.</p>

<p>For a taste of what I’m talking about, here is a collage of the dependencies (that I can <em>think</em> of) we have on my current project:</p>

<figure><img src="/images/dependency-overload.jpg" alt="Dependencies"><figcaption>Dependencies</figcaption></figure>

<p>(There’s not really any good reason HAML goes in the center. <a href="http://http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a> chose to put it there.)</p>

<p>Of course, anyone who’s worked on a software project of any size before will not be particularly surprised by this. That’s not even <em>that many</em> dependencies compared to some software projects.</p>

<p>But guys. They’re <strong>dependencies</strong>. That means if something goes wrong with any one of those tools/technologies depicted above, it’s a show-stopper for us (as in: we must address <em>that</em> issue before we can continue working on <em>our</em> software).</p>

<p>I think <a href="/posts/acquired-needs-of-software-engineers.html">I’ve actually made a similar point before</a>. And, as I said then, I want to stress that I’m <em>not</em> saying we should abandon these (very useful) tools. I think what I’ve come to realize in my limited time as a software developer is simply that when you start reaching for external tools to do your job, you should take a moment to consider that a <strong>tool</strong> becomes a <strong>dependency</strong> very quickly; and the option to <strong>just not use it</strong> should always be <em>considered</em>, if not chosen.</p>
