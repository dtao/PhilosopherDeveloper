<p>My wife told me recently about a conversation she had with a coworker regarding morality and religion. It was essentially a disagreement about where the concepts of <em>good</em> and <em>evil</em> come from. They both believe rather strongly that these are real things; but my wife&#8217;s coworker, being a Christian, believes that good and evil are based on a supernatural reality (God), whereas my wife views them as notions that evolved along with our species and helped us to form prosperous societies.</p>

<p>One thing that got me thinking is a point that my wife&#8217;s coworker made in support of his view. I am probably not doing it justice, but from what I understand he basically said this. If we accept the existence of good and evil, then we must acknowledge that it had to come from somewhere. &#8220;A law needs a lawmaker&#8221; was the way he put it.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say this is a bad point. It&#8217;s one that I&#8217;ve actually heard, in one form or another, from many people, including my parents. But I think it contains an embedded assumption that most of us don&#8217;t really question, and which is worth exploring.</p>

<p>This assumption is, I believe, deeply rooted in our consciousness: that <strong>the ultimate cause of any event must be a person</strong> (or an intelligent <em>being</em> of some kind). It makes sense, in a way. Not in the sense that it&#8217;s necessarily <em>true</em> (at least, I don&#8217;t think it is), but rather that it gives us a model of the world that&#8217;s quite useful for our purposes.</p>

<p>To understand what I mean, imagine you come home one day and you find that your things are strewn about and something valuable&#8211;say, an expensive watch&#8211;is missing. What is your assumption? Naturally, that someone broke into your home and rifled through your things, then absconded with the watch. It&#8217;s perfectly sensible to draw this conclusion, based on the evidence; furthermore, viewing the situation in this way would prompt you to take what would very likely be a useful next step: contacting the police, and working with them to apprehend the thief.</p>

<p>I say &#8220;useful next step&#8221; rather than &#8220;logical next step&#8221; very deliberately. We give our minds a lot of credit for being logical; but I really view them more as being pragmatic. A baby may learn through trial and error how to persuade its parents into giving [COMPLETE THIS PARAGRAPH].</p>

<p>This will sound absurd, I know. But rather than assuming a person (or an <em>agent</em>) were responsible, you <em>could</em> just throw your hands in the air and say, &#8220;Well shucks! I wish that didn&#8217;t happen, but it did,&#8221; without questioning the matter any further. I am not suggesting that this would be a reasonable reaction, only pointing out that it is one way that you <em>could</em> react: <strong>by not looking for a cause at all</strong>.</p>

<p>I mention this because it is one extreme on a <em>spectrum of possible reactions</em>. The <em>opposite</em> extreme would be this. Suppose the police did their investigation, found a culprit, and arrested him armed with a compelling body of evidence. Most people would be satisfied at this point (assuming they were compensated for their lost property in some way). But you might not be. You might choose to question <em>why</em> the thief intruded into your home and chose to steal from you.</p>

<p>Without even thinking very long about it, you can immediately see that this pursuit, while valid in the sense that there is likely more to this story than a person randomly deciding to steal (i.e., we all know that individuals are led to crime by many factors, which I couldn&#8217;t possibly pretend to enumerate in full), would be endless. You could ask why this person turned to burglary, and surely you would come up with some answers explaining the decision. But these answers would lead to more questions, the answers to which would open up more questions still. This is a phenomenon anyone with children knows all too well: the question <em>Why?</em> can be asked of anything, indefinitely, without ever getting to the bottom of things.</p>

<p>And this is why we don&#8217;t do it. After all, does it really matter <em>why</em> someone stole from you, when all you really care about is (1) getting your watch back and (2) ensuring this person won&#8217;t steal from you again?</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t. Which brings me to the corollary of my earlier claim that we tend to believe everything can be traced back to an agent: <strong>once we find an agent in the search for a cause, we stop looking</strong>.</p>
