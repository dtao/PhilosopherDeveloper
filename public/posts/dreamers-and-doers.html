    <p>A lot of people have written about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-In-Women-Work-Will/dp/0385349947/">Sheryl Sandberg’s <em>Lean In</em></a> since the book was published this year. I haven’t actually read the book—and probably never will<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>–but today it struck me that the discussion has much in common with many other disparate views on the world, and I wanted to point that out.</p>

<p>The most recent example I can recall of a similar discussion is one my wife and I had with a couple of our friends about a week ago. We were talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel">Peter Thiel</a>–one of the founders of PayPal—specifically about his infamous opinion that more young people should be skipping college, or at least college as we currently know it<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. One of our friends vehemently disagreed with Thiel, for the simple reason that statistically speaking college has a very positive impact on future earning potential in our country, especially for those coming from lower income levels. She contrasted this with graduate school, which she did remark was typically a waste of time in economic terms. (She then proceeded to note that I went the grad school and spent the next fifteen minutes laughing at me.)</p>

<p>I would characterize the rest of us in the conversation as being much more sympathetic to Thiel’s point of view, even if we didn’t exactly agree with him. Ultimately the observation I made was that we seemed to be talking about the issue from two very different points of view. I believe Thiel’s argument is <em>not</em> that, given any random individual who’s contemplating attending college, he or she should decide not to go. Rather, he’s criticizing the <em>system</em> that has developed in our country where many individuals don’t actually benefit from the <em>educational</em> aspect of a university education, but simply from receiving a degree after four years and the additional career opportunities afforded by that symbolic piece of paper.</p>

<p>It isn’t that I have any aversion to reading the book. It’s just that there are many titles on my to-read list ahead of <em>Lean In</em>; and the list is growing, not shrinking. <a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>

<p>For an excellent debate on this topic, featuring Thiel and several others, I highly recommend <a href="http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/550-too-many-kids-go-to-college-our-first-debate-in-chicago">Intelligence Squared: Too many kids go to college</a>. <a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
