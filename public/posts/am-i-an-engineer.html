    <p>Most people outside of the software development profession (and even many on the inside) may not realize that there is some disagreement within the community as to whether or not software development is a form of <em>engineering</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s say you placed software developers along a spectrum, where at one end “engineering” might as well be a foreign word, and at the other end writing software is <em>obviously</em> a form of engineering, in much the same way that painting or sculpture is obviously a form of art.</p>

<figure><img class="plain" src="/images/engineering-spectrum.png" alt="Is software development a form of engineering?"><figcaption>Is software development a form of engineering?</figcaption></figure>

<p>Personally, I have worked at various points along this spectrum. My first software development job was at a trading company in Philadelphia, which would have falled pretty close to the extreme left end (we had one teammate who would have preferred otherwise, but the rest of us were far too hacky for him to shift the culture to the right). At <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> I would say the culture was somewhere in the middle, with plenty of developers leaning in both directions (I definitely worked with self-professed “engineers” at ThoughtWorks, as well as individuals who vehemently rejected that label).</p>

<p>More recently I’ve worked in environments that fall much closer to the right side of the spectrum. The culture at <a href="http://www.cardpool.com">Cardpool</a>–founded by two former Microsoft employees and with its first two hires from Google—was, not surprisingly, firmly in the software-as-engineering camp. I would expect no different from most large software companies (or developers from large-software-company roots). And a couple of weeks ago I started at Google, which I’m will be about as far to the right as I’ll ever get at in my career.</p>

<p>(By the way, it’s probably not a coincidence that I chose to assign the left and right sides of the spectrum to the viewpoints that I did; read <a href="https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz">Steve Yegge’s argument</a> that software developers fall into “liberal” and “conservative” groups to get an interesting view on a related subject. And while you’re at it, also read Richard Gabriel’s <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html">The Rise of <em>Worse is Better</em></a> for a much older but very similar perspective on two approaches to software, which he deems the “MIT approach” versus the “New Jersey approach”.)</p>

<p>A term that seems to have grown in popularity since I’ve been working is <em>software craftsman</em>. I don’t know that this term is always intended to be in direct opposition to the idea of “software engineering”; but I think it is nonetheless a handy go-to comparison for serving as a counterpoint to the perspective that software is definitely engineering.</p>

<p>Which brings me to a disclaimer I probably should have made earlier: I myself find myself leaning towards the left on this spectrum, so I am certainly biased. That said, I don’t consider either side to be the “correct” way of viewing software; and in fact, I believe the very attitude that holds one side to be superior to another is probably the most “incorrect” of all possible views on the matter. My primary reason for bringing this up is simply to point out that these different perspectives exist and to do my best to highlight some important ways in which they are similar, despite their obvious differences.</p>

<p>But before I continue: <strong>what am I talking about?</strong> I’m sure at least <em>someone</em> reading this has no idea what I’m suggesting by the terms “engineer” or “craftsman.” So let me provide a (relatively) quick, totally oversimplified contrast between these two ideas.</p>

<h2 id="what_is_an_engineer_1">What is an engineer?</h2>

<figure><img src="/images/engineer-at-work.jpg" alt="An engineers at work"><figcaption>An engineers at work</figcaption></figure>

<p>In <strong>broad, overly general terms</strong>, here’s how I’d describe a software engineer.</p>

<p>Her <strong>code is the product</strong>. She takes pride in its quality and thinks through her designs carefully.</p>

<p>Of course, she wants her code to lead to useful software, which is why it is important that significant thought goes into writing requirements for it. Sometimes an engineer will take ownership of a project’s requirements, but sometimes that will be someone else’s job. If her code is written well and meets requirements, but those requirements turned out to be wrong or poorly defined, an engineer may still feel proud of her work. Her code could still be elegant, even if the product as a whole didn’t turn out to be a success for other reasons.</p>

<p>To an engineer, <strong>the practice of writing software is a discipline</strong>. There is a right way to do it; and although it’s naturally impossible to ever be 100% there, knowledge and experience equip good engineers to get closer and closer over time, as they learn from experience and apply what they’ve learned to their future work.</p>

<p>If I may be abstract for a moment, I picture an engineer’s development—not of code, but of herself—as being like the growth of a redwood: up and up, better and better.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/redwood-tree.jpg" alt="An engineer grows like a redwood."><figcaption>An engineer grows like a redwood.</figcaption></figure>

<p>More experience → more knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="what_is_a_craftsman_2">What is a craftsman?</h2>

<figure><img src="/images/craftsman-at-work.jpg" alt="A craftsman at work"><figcaption>A craftsman at work</figcaption></figure>

<p>Just a reminder: I am biased here. But this is how I’d describe a so-called “craftsman.”</p>

<p>His <strong>code is a tool</strong>. A tool degrades and becomes blunt over time; this is unavoidable. But naturally, if a tool is useful then you sharpen it periodically to ensure that it continues to be useful. Tools that are seldom used and have worn out or rusted can be discarded or replaced.</p>

<p>He cares more that his code leads to useful software than that it is elegant or well designed. In fact, if he spent a time making his code elegant but the requirements were poorly designed and the resulting software is not useful, a craftsman will be deeply upset because his time was wasted. For this reason a craftsman will almost always take at least partial ownership in ensuring that the requirements for a project make sense.</p>

<p>To a craftsman, <strong>writing software is a craft</strong>, based on creativity and technique. There is not a “right” way; there are many ways. Experience alone does not necessarily bring one closer to an ideal (because there is no single ideal). Instead, the more a craftsman learns, the more diverse his set of tools becomes; and his craft is more colorful as a result.</p>

<p>I imagine a craftsman’s growth as more like that of baobab tree: out and out, broader and broader.</p>

<p>More experience → more perspective.</p>
