    <p>When my wife and I moved from Philadelphia to San Francisco in 2010, we brought our espresso machine with us.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/espresso_machine_thumb.jpg" alt="Our espresso machine"><figcaption>Our espresso machine</figcaption></figure>

<p>Back in Philly, we’d had a modest kitchen with just enough counter space for the machine. On lazy weekend mornings, I’d often turn it on and prepare us each a latte drink. It was a nice little ritual.</p>

<p>So we brought it to San Francisco with us. But our first apartment, a little studio we rented from a friend of a friend, didn’t have the room for it. So the machine went into storage.</p>

<p>Then in 2011, we moved to our current apartment in the Mission. The espresso machine is back; but we don’t have quite the counter space that we did in Philadelphia, so it’s sitting on a little cart underneath our microwave, unplugged.</p>

<figure><img src="/images/espresso_machine2.jpg" alt="Our espresso machine now"><figcaption>Our espresso machine now</figcaption></figure>

<p>This isn’t terribly inconvenient. To use it, I only need to pick it up and set it somewhere—say, on our table—then put it back when I’m finished. Still, the fact remains: <strong>I haven’t used it once</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> since moving here.</p>

<p>How strange, that such a small and seemingly insignificant detail could have such a disproportionate impact on our lives! Instead of plugged in and on the counter, the espresso machine is unplugged and a few feet lower. That’s a small change. But now instead of using the machine every week or so, I <em>never</em> use it. That’s a comparatively <em>big</em> change.</p>

<h2 id="our_programmable_selves_1">Our programmable selves</h2>

<p>I’ve pondered this from time to time, and an idea that keeps recurring to me is that <strong>we humans are programmable</strong>. At least to an extent. Simply by recognizing that my internal decision-making circuitry seems to ignore the espresso machine when it’s near the ground but will actually commit to using it when it’s on the counter, I can alter my behavior by changing its location.</p>

<p>It’s a silly example, but I think this is actually a really important point. The distinction here is essentially the difference between <em>manual</em> and <em>automatic</em> processes. We are most effective when we are able to automate the things we do; that much is obvious. But getting software or robots to do all of our grunt work for us isn’t the only kind of automation. I would define<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> automation as the act of replacing any process requiring manual input with one that does not, but yields acceptable (often better) results.</p>

<p>A few years ago, a friend asked me to help him out with an idea for a software product. I offered to help without payment, but he insisted on paying me. He explained that if he paid me, he knew I would force myself to do the work. Otherwise, I might view our agreement as little more than me doing him a favor, in which case I’d be more likely to drag my feet. Cynical or not, it was a totally legitimate view, and another perfect example of what I’m talking about. Effectively my friend wanted to replace a <em>manual</em> process—me consciously taking the time to help out a friend—with an <em>automatic</em> one—me responding to an internal, and basically involuntary, sense of obligation.</p>

<p>This kind of self-programming is hugely powerful, and is something I think we need to spend more time thinking about.</p>

<h2 id="how_we_get_it_wrong_2">How we get it wrong</h2>

<p>An interesting obstacle to self-automation that I’ve noticed among people I’ve worked with is the tendency to <strong>value manual effort</strong>. We appreciate when others take the time to stop what they’re doing and help us with something. And so there’s a sense of pride that comes with being asked to help out somewhere. We all love to feel needed, after all.</p>

<p>This makes it very easy to miss cases when the effort we spend is actually wasteful.</p>

<p>Imagine that my espresso machine were incredibly heavy, so heavy that I couldn’t even lift it. And suppose I had some much stronger friend who was capable of lifting it. Then whenever my friend was around and I was in the mood for some espresso, I would ask him to pick up the machine and put it on the table for me, so I could plug it in and use it. This arrangement might feel good to my friend as it would make him feel useful.</p>

<p>That actually isn’t the full story. The real reason I <em>still</em> haven’t used it is that there’s a part that we apparently lost somewhere between Philadelphia and here. But I’ve only included this detail in a footnote because it doesn’t really change my argument; I only even <em>noticed</em> this part was missing after we’d already been in our new apartment for several months. So it’s clear that I am not using the machine nearly as often as I used to. In addition, I’m hoping that by writing this post I will motivate myself to finally order a replacement for that part! <a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>

<p>And don’t bother pointing me to an actual dictionary definition; I tend to be fairly dismissive of such things. But that’s a topic for a future post! <a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
