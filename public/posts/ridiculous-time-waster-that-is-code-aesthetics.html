    <p>Sometimes it drives me nuts how passionate software engineers can be about things that have nothing to do with the functionality of their software.</p>

<p><em>Code aesthetics</em> is one such thing. (Those of you non-programmers out there: yes, believe it or not, this <em>is</em> a big deal to some engineers.) Developers will argue for hours about whether one way or another of writing code is “better,” for all sorts of absurdly subjective reasons. Among them:</p>

<ul>
<li>“It’s more readable.” I always find this one kind of funny as it completely <a href="http://begthequestion.info/">begs the question</a>. It’s like saying, “I personally prefer the way this one looks because it’s better-looking.” Of course <em>you</em> think the code is more readable your way; that’s why we’re arguing!</li>

<li>“It’s more concise.” This is another popular one. Interestingly, it is often (though not always) in direct opposition to the preceding point.</li>

<li>“It’s more obvious.” This one I actually can sympathize with. However, I <em>do</em> hate it (give me a few more years in the industry and maybe I’ll change my mind) when the “more obvious” version of a routine is preferred despite the fact that it’s also the “more stupid” version. I only agree with going with the “obvious” approach when the difference between <em>it</em> and an alternative with superior performance (for example) is negligble, <em>or</em> when the “superior” version is incredibly nasty (e.g., uses pointer hacks or some obscure implementation detail to accomplish a goal).</li>
</ul><p>Here are some common examples of aesthetic issues which .NET developers argue about:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// Whether or not to use var for locals.</span>
<span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">puppy</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">GetPuppy</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="n">Puppy</span> <span class="n">puppy</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">GetPuppy</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1">// Whether to put the statement in a one-line block on the same line,</span>
<span class="c1">// on the next line, or within braces.</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">someCondition</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">someCondition</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">someCondition</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// Whether to put the opening brace on the same line or the following line</span>
<span class="c1">// after a statement block.</span>
<span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Kitty</span> <span class="n">k</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">kitties</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">k</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Purr</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Kitty</span> <span class="n">k</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">kitties</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">k</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Purr</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// Whether to put constants on the left or right of conditionals.</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="m">0</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="k">value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">value</span> <span class="p">==</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The above are just a few examples. I’ve got another, which a coworker and I discussed just today (<em>very</em> briefly, thankfully): whether methods that return <code>boolean</code> values (I’m actually on a Java project—<strong>can you believe it?</strong>) should be phrased in the <em>positive</em> or in the <em>negative</em>.</p>

<p>Well, that’s not entirely fair. The truth is that my rule of thumb has basically always been to use a positive phrasing and then negate it from the calling side when necessary. For instance:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">isDone</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">someMember</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">doSomeLogic</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span>

<span class="c1">// Code elsewhere</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(!</span><span class="n">someObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">isDone</span><span class="o">())</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">doSomething</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>To me, the above is <strong>perfectly reasonable</strong>. But I discovered today, to my surprise, that some developers don’t think so. In fact, not only did my colleague <em>not</em> like the above (he preferred to call the method <code>isNotDone</code> in the first place), he recalled a little coding exercise he and another colleague performed for a Ruby project some time ago that honestly made me shudder. Apparently, in order to avoid the dreaded <code>!</code> symbol (gasp!), they actually wrote a module to dynamically generate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">duck typed</a> methods that would return the opposite result of whatever was being called, e.g.:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">someObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">not</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">done</span>
    <span class="c1"># oh my goodness</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>“Seriously?” I asked him. “Just to avoid having to type ’!’?”</p>

<p>Apparently, some people care <em>that much</em>.</p>
