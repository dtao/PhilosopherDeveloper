<p>There are a couple of “bigger” topics that I’ve been wanting to write about lately (not big as in <em>important</em>, of course–more big as in being more work to write about); but I can’t seem to find the time (read: make the effort). So here’s a fun little challenge for now.</p>

<p>The background is that I recently discovered an interesting performance optimization in Chrome. It has to do with concatenating strings in JavaScript. Those of us with backgrounds in Java or C# will immediately recollect the hard lesson we’ve all learned at some point (and those of you who haven’t yet: you are about to!) about concatenating strings with <code>+=</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function String joinStrings(List&lt;String&gt; strings) {
    String joined = "";
    for (String str : strings) {
        joined += str;
    }
    return joined;
}</code></pre>

<p>I would wager we’ve <em>all</em>, at some point or another, written a function similar to the Java snippet above. Maybe it was when we were in class; hopefully it wasn’t while we were writing production software where performance is a major priority. In any case, sooner or later, every developer finds out that the code above is extremely inefficient</p>
