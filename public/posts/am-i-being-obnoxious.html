<p>I&#8217;ve noticed I tend to have two conflicting inclinations in a lot of day-to-day situations at work:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have a lot of opinions about how things could be done better</li>

<li>I strongly believe that in order to effect change, it&#8217;s important not to turn people against you</li>
</ol>

<p>The latter seems like a no-brainer, and yet it frequently gets in the way of the former.</p>

<p>For example, I often participate in meetings during which the discussion becomes derailed on a side tangent, or the group loses focus making jokes or telling stories. Sometimes one-on-one dialogues emerge while the rest of the room sits quietly, waiting politely for the two individuals who are monopolizing the meeting to check themselves. Invariably, <em>after</em> meetings such as this there are grumblings amongst a few of the participants about how unnecessarily long and pointless the meeting was. (Though I&#8217;m not proud of it, I am generally a part of this group.)</p>

<p>Why should this happen? I ask myself this on a regular basis. It seems that if not one but <em>multiple</em> people are aware that the meeting is veering off track, or that it is somehow not running effectively, surely someone ought to speak up. But no one does, and it&#8217;s because of the second point above. Speaking for myself, at least, I don&#8217;t want to disrupt the flow of things just to voice my discontent at how the conversation is progressing. I could do more damage than good. People might get defensive. I could inadvertently harm team morale. Besides, just because <em>I</em> am not engaged in the conversation, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a waste of <em>everyone&#8217;s</em> time.</p>

<p>Of course, these fears reflect a risk-averse attitude that is perhaps not particularly beneficial to whatever project I&#8217;m on. In general, I do think it&#8217;s valuable to ask the question <em>Am I being obnoxious?</em>, but even with that in mind it&#8217;s probably better to speak up rather than remain silent when you have an idea about how to improve a team process. Assuming you work with reasonable people (which I do), the worst-case outcome should be a discussion that, while it may not lead to any actual changes (i.e., if your teammates disagree with you), will at least get everyone thinking about ways to improve as a team.</p>
