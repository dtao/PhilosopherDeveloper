    <p>It is a well-known fact among my teammates that my tolerance for hacks is higher than most developers’. And so it is that sometimes I write code that others find horrifying.</p>

<p>Here’s one that I personally like, and which has caused more than one of my teammates to chuckle in half-approval. It came up again just today, as we are using <a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/">Padrino</a> on my current project and a coworker wanted to know if Sinatra and/or Padrino had an equivalent to the Rails console (to allow a dev to poke around the system at some arbitrary point during the program’s execution—say, in the middle of handling a request at the controller level).</p>

<p>Frankly, I’m no Sinatra expert. For all I know there <em>is</em> an equivalent to the Rails console in Sinatra. I’ve never really cared, because if I want to poke around the code mid-request I just whip up something like this, which I shall call the <strong>littlest Ruby debugger</strong>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Start typing away."</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">STDIN</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="s2">""</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="nb">eval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">line</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Yes, yes, I know. Any developer who lets something like that slip into production code deserves to be shot. But I would honestly argue that the chances of that are so close to zero as to be completely unworthy of any serious consideration.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the above hack in action, responding to a request on my local machine (with my commands highlighted):</p>
<pre>  DEBUG -      GET (0.0120ms) /layouts/ - 200

    <p>I noticed something funny about myself this morning while making coffee.</p>
    
    <p>The kitchen in my wife’s and my apartment is divided into a main area and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scullery_(room)">scullery</a> (yep, we’re old fashioned). The scullery holds our silverware, dishes, coffee, tea, and other things. But the coffee <em>maker</em> is in the main area, on a cart.</p>
    
    <p>This morning I went into the kitchen, put a filter in the coffee maker, took the carafe and brought it with me into the scullery. In the scullery I filled the carafe with water, took the coffee and walked back to the cart in the kitchen. I filled the machine with enough water for two cups of coffee, collected an emptied sugar packet that was sitting on the cart, and tossed it into the trash on my way back to the scullery, where I poured out the excess water from the carafe and picked up a mug and a spoon before heading back to the cart.</p>
    
    <p>What I noticed about this whole procedure (after having gone through it, of course) is that I had <strong>optimized</strong> my trips to and from the scullery—not perfectly, by any means, but to some extent. That is, rather than making a trip for one purpose (e.g., filling the carafe with water), I <em>combined</em> tasks so as to reduce the total number of trips back and forth. And what was particularly noteworthy to me was that I had done this <em>without really thinking about it</em>.</p>
    
    <p>Recently I interviewed an engineer for ThoughtWorks. It was a technical phone interview, so much of the conversation was relatively high-level (I figured, save the whiteboard problems for in-office interviews). Even so, I did throw in a few problems, emphasizing to the candidate that the goal of the exercise was for her to share <span class="post-link">...

    <p>When I was younger my grandpa taught me and my sister a little trick. He said to me, “I can calculate how many hairs are on your sister’s head.” It seemed preposterous to my young mind; the number was surely so astronomical as to be beyond any intelligent guess. But I was curious.</p>

<p>What my grandpa did was to start with individual hairs. He counted 1, 2, up to ten, and held that many strands between two fingers. “This is ten,” he said. Then, using roughly that many strands now as a unit, he counted out 9 more units of similar size, collecting them between the same two fingers. He now held roughly ten times the number of hairs from before. “This,” he said, very seriously as he wanted to make sure we were paying attention, “is about a hundred.”</p>

<p>I may have been a kid, but I immediately saw where he was going. Next, he counted by approximate hundreds, covering more and more area on my sister’s head. He didn’t have to keep holding it all between his fingers; it became reasonable at a certain point (maybe 100, maybe 1000) to eyeball it.</p>

<p>Of course, I have no memory of what the actual end result was. And obviously, it was not a precisely accurate number. But there’s no doubt in my mind that it was an <strong>accurate ballpark</strong> estimate. My grandpa never studied human anatomy, but he figured out within an order of magnitude how many hairs were on my head with <strike>a minimal</strike> an <em>optimal</em> amount of effort.</p>

<p>Often, in software, ballpark estimates are exactly what we want. Particularly in your stereotypical “agile” project, where the client understands that absolute estimates are tough to produce but relative estimates are easy and that’s why we use story points, <em>yada</em> <span class="post-link">...

    <p>I’ve noticed I tend to have two conflicting inclinations in a lot of day-to-day situations at work:</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>I have a lot of opinions about how things could be done better</li>
    
    <li>I strongly believe that in order to effect change, it’s important not to turn people against you</li>
    </ol><p>The latter seems like a no-brainer, and yet it frequently gets in the way of the former.</p>
    
    <p>For example, I often participate in meetings during which the discussion becomes derailed on a side tangent, or the group loses focus making jokes or telling stories. Sometimes one-on-one dialogues emerge while the rest of the room sits quietly, waiting politely for the two individuals who are monopolizing the meeting to check themselves. Invariably, <em>after</em> meetings such as this there are grumblings amongst a few of the participants about how unnecessarily long and pointless the meeting was. (Though I’m not proud of it, I am generally a part of this group.)</p>
    
    <p>Why should this happen? I ask myself this on a regular basis. It seems that if not one but <em>multiple</em> people are aware that the meeting is veering off track, or that it is somehow not running effectively, surely someone ought to speak up. But no one does, and it’s because of the second point above. Speaking for myself, at least, I don’t want to disrupt the flow of things just to voice my discontent at how the conversation is progressing. I could do more damage than good. People might get defensive. I could inadvertently harm team morale. Besides, just because <em>I</em> am not engaged in the conversation, that doesn’t mean it’s a waste of <em>everyone’s</em> time.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, these fears reflect a risk-averse attitude that is perhaps not particularly beneficial to whatever project I’m on. In general, I do think it’s valuable to ask <span class="post-link">... (<a href="/posts/am-i-being-obnoxious.html">read the full post</a>)</span></p>

    <p>Something’s been stirring around in my head lately, and it’s going to seem somewhat heretical to those firmly planted in a particular school of thought. Essentially I’ve been questioning the way continuous integration is done on some of the software projects I’ve seen, at ThoughtWorks and elsewhere.</p>
    
    <p>More broadly, I guess my skepticism isn’t specifically about continuous integration, but rather about test-driven development with TDD and, more importantly, BDD (i.e., with a language like Gherkin/Cucumber for defining feature requirements and a UI automation tool such as Selenium for driving acceptance tests).</p>
    
    <p>To be clear, I view TDD and BDD as extremely useful techniques; and CI is a powerful tool to maximize their effectiveness. I would even accept that we are better off using a test-driven approach for 100% of development than we would be if we used no TDD. But that isn’t the same as saying 100% TDD is optimal or that we should get started with BDD immediately on every project. Like most everything else in life, I believe it is ultimately a matter of achieving the right balance, which requires good judgment.</p>
    
    <p>As a bit of background, I have had conversations with colleagues who have agreed with me that sometimes testing is not necessary or appropriate. The attitude I have picked up as a general rule of thumb is that for spiking out software prototypes—throwaway versions that we acknowledge in advance will probably differ dramatically from any actual release—we can often move faster by coding features without testing them. TDD might still be useful in this context, however, as one of its benefits is that it assists the developer in thinking through the implementation of a tricky piece of logic. But its usefulness here is actually in <em>increasing</em> development speed (which is important for a prototype), not in <span class="post-link">...
