    <p>When I was younger my grandpa taught me and my sister a little trick. He said to me, “I can calculate how many hairs are on your sister’s head.” It seemed preposterous to my young mind; the number was surely so astronomical as to be beyond any intelligent guess. But I was curious.</p>

<p>What my grandpa did was to start with individual hairs. He counted 1, 2, up to ten, and held that many strands between two fingers. “This is ten,” he said. Then, using roughly that many strands now as a unit, he counted out 9 more units of similar size, collecting them between the same two fingers. He now held roughly ten times the number of hairs from before. “This,” he said, very seriously as he wanted to make sure we were paying attention, “is about a hundred.”</p>

<p>I may have been a kid, but I immediately saw where he was going. Next, he counted by approximate hundreds, covering more and more area on my sister’s head. He didn’t have to keep holding it all between his fingers; it became reasonable at a certain point (maybe 100, maybe 1000) to eyeball it.</p>

<p>Of course, I have no memory of what the actual end result was. And obviously, it was not a precisely accurate number. But there’s no doubt in my mind that it was an <strong>accurate ballpark</strong> estimate. My grandpa never studied human anatomy, but he figured out within an order of magnitude how many hairs were on my head with <strike>a minimal</strike> an <em>optimal</em> amount of effort.</p>

<p>Often, in software, ballpark estimates are exactly what we want. Particularly in your stereotypical “agile” project, where the client understands that absolute estimates are tough to produce but relative estimates are easy and that’s why we use story points, <em>yada</em> <span class="post-link">...

    <p>I’ve noticed I tend to have two conflicting inclinations in a lot of day-to-day situations at work:</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>I have a lot of opinions about how things could be done better</li>
    
    <li>I strongly believe that in order to effect change, it’s important not to turn people against you</li>
    </ol><p>The latter seems like a no-brainer, and yet it frequently gets in the way of the former.</p>
    
    <p>For example, I often participate in meetings during which the discussion becomes derailed on a side tangent, or the group loses focus making jokes or telling stories. Sometimes one-on-one dialogues emerge while the rest of the room sits quietly, waiting politely for the two individuals who are monopolizing the meeting to check themselves. Invariably, <em>after</em> meetings such as this there are grumblings amongst a few of the participants about how unnecessarily long and pointless the meeting was. (Though I’m not proud of it, I am generally a part of this group.)</p>
    
    <p>Why should this happen? I ask myself this on a regular basis. It seems that if not one but <em>multiple</em> people are aware that the meeting is veering off track, or that it is somehow not running effectively, surely someone ought to speak up. But no one does, and it’s because of the second point above. Speaking for myself, at least, I don’t want to disrupt the flow of things just to voice my discontent at how the conversation is progressing. I could do more damage than good. People might get defensive. I could inadvertently harm team morale. Besides, just because <em>I</em> am not engaged in the conversation, that doesn’t mean it’s a waste of <em>everyone’s</em> time.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, these fears reflect a risk-averse attitude that is perhaps not particularly beneficial to whatever project I’m on. In general, I do think it’s valuable to ask <span class="post-link">... (<a href="/posts/am-i-being-obnoxious.html">read the full post</a>)</span></p>

    <p>Something’s been stirring around in my head lately, and it’s going to seem somewhat heretical to those firmly planted in a particular school of thought. Essentially I’ve been questioning the way continuous integration is done on some of the software projects I’ve seen, at ThoughtWorks and elsewhere.</p>
    
    <p>More broadly, I guess my skepticism isn’t specifically about continuous integration, but rather about test-driven development with TDD and, more importantly, BDD (i.e., with a language like Gherkin/Cucumber for defining feature requirements and a UI automation tool such as Selenium for driving acceptance tests).</p>
    
    <p>To be clear, I view TDD and BDD as extremely useful techniques; and CI is a powerful tool to maximize their effectiveness. I would even accept that we are better off using a test-driven approach for 100% of development than we would be if we used no TDD. But that isn’t the same as saying 100% TDD is optimal or that we should get started with BDD immediately on every project. Like most everything else in life, I believe it is ultimately a matter of achieving the right balance, which requires good judgment.</p>
    
    <p>As a bit of background, I have had conversations with colleagues who have agreed with me that sometimes testing is not necessary or appropriate. The attitude I have picked up as a general rule of thumb is that for spiking out software prototypes—throwaway versions that we acknowledge in advance will probably differ dramatically from any actual release—we can often move faster by coding features without testing them. TDD might still be useful in this context, however, as one of its benefits is that it assists the developer in thinking through the implementation of a tricky piece of logic. But its usefulness here is actually in <em>increasing</em> development speed (which is important for a prototype), not in <span class="post-link">...

    <p>I know it’s been a long time since I’ve written (<em>especially</em> for someone who’s repeatedly claimed he will write daily posts). I’ve got some more substantial ideas to discuss in the near future (honest!)<strike>, but this particular post is going to be a short one</strike>. [Correction: this post ended up being kinda long.]</p>

<p>On my current project we’re in the process of wrapping up a mobile website we built using <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a>. One issue we encountered during development was that on certain pages, a strange “ghost click” behavior was observed: the user would click a button, the page would change, and then a button on the destination page (positioned at the same location as the original button) would seem to be automatically clicked as if the user had clicked twice—or as if a <em>ghost</em> had clicked it.</p>

<p>It turns out that this is a known issue for mobile web browsers, which <a href="http://code.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons.html">Google wrote about back in January</a>. In the article, Ryan Fioravanti explains that most mobile browsers introduce a delay of ~300 ms before every <code>click</code> event, for the reason that they want to account for the possibility that the user might be double-clicking to zoom in on the page. So what can happen on a mobile web project this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone notices that the UI seems sluggish. In particular, clicking on buttons feels very slow.</li>

<li>A developer looks into the problem and finds that the issue can be mitigated by handling an event other than <code>click</code>, such as <code>touchstart</code> (jQuery Mobile has a <code>vclick</code> event).</li>

<li>Now that the clickable element in question handles a non-<code>click</code> event, when it is clicked, <strong>there is still a <code>click</code> event waiting to be triggered within the next ~300 ms</strong>; and so if a page <span class="post-link">...

    <p>Faithful readers. There was an <strong>error</strong> in my previous post about refreshing styles in a jQuery Mobile app!</p>

<p><em>Ahhh!!!</em> I can hear you screaming. Calm down; <strong>I have a fix!</strong></p>

<p>(Warning: I’m not 100% sure I <em>understand</em> this fix; but hey, it’s JavaScript! <em>Nobody</em> really understands it, right?)</p>

<p>A refresher: what I suggested was this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">refreshStyles</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">$element</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">$wrapper</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$element</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">wrap</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;div&gt;"</span> <span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// This is a mistake!</span>
  <span class="nx">$wrapper</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">page</span><span class="p">();</span>                         <span class="c1">// This doesn't work!</span>
  <span class="nx">$element</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">unwrap</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The above code doesn’t work because <code>wrap</code> returns the <em>wrapped</em> element (not the <em>wrapper</em> element).</p>

<p>Here’s that fix I mentioned (incidentally, this is how it was coded in our code base at work all along… go figure):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">refreshStyles</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">$element</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">$element</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">wrap</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'&lt;div id="refresh-styles-wrapper"&gt;'</span> <span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// Look Ma, no local!</span>
  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"#refresh-styles-wrapper"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">page</span><span class="p">();</span>                  <span class="c1">// Egads! It works!</span>
  <span class="nx">$element</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">unwrap</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>So yeah, somehow forcing jQuery to <em>re-find</em> the wrapper element makes everything honky dory. And if you don’t believe me, check it out:</p>

<p>I have this theory that JavaScript is the language with the greatest percentage of <em>hackers</em>, as opposed to actual developers. By which I mean, most of us just <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">fiddle around</a> with JS code until it works; but we don’t entirely <em>get</em> what we’re doing. At least that’s the case with me. (Don’t tell my employer.) <a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
