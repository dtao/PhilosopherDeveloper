    <p>When I was a kid I played a lot of video games. And there was this funny thing about the way I played them: sometimes, even if the game was going well, I had this impulse to <em>restart</em>. Maybe because I hadn’t played the level perfectly—I had lost some health, or hadn’t collected all the coins, or missed the secret passageway. Or maybe it was just because I liked the beginning of the game so much I wanted to play it again. In any case, it’s an impulse I remember quite clearly, and one which carries over into real life now that I’m an adult.</p>

<p>An interesting byproduct of this tendency of mine to replay levels in video games is that it made me <strong>very good at the early stages</strong>. If I played level X over and over in order to collect all the coins, eventually I would get to a point where I could basically breeze through most of the level. This isn’t altogether too surprising, of course, given the existence of the phrase “practice makes perfect.” But there is a flip side to that coin as well. The more I repeated the early levels of a game, the longer I postponed actually getting to the <em>end</em> of the game; and when I did I was relatively unprepared for it. The final stages always seemed really hard compared to the earlier parts that I repeated so often.</p>

<p>I see a tie-in to this childhood dilemma—fundamentally, to restart or keep going—in the world of software, particularly here in Silicon Valley. In an industry where everyone’s dream seems to be founding a start-up and either bringing it to IPO or getting acquired by some larger company, where a litany of 1-year engagements at VC-funded and possibly failed start-ups is<span class="post-link">...

    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</a> is a powerful technique used by a growing number of software teams. Personally, I have issues with the way CI is done on a lot of software projects. I’ve <a href="/posts/being-agile-with-continuous-integration.html">tried to write about this once before</a>, but at the time the ideas bouncing around in my head hadn’t really crystalized. To be honest, they <em>still</em> haven’t fully (if you’ve ever worked and/or debated with me, you’d be right to wonder if they ever will); but I figured it was time to give it another shot anyway. And in typical me fashion, I’d like to start with an analogy.</p>

<h2 id="the_puzzled_factory_owner_1">The Puzzled Factory Owner</h2>

<p>Imagine a factory owner wants to reduce the occurrence of defects and thereby improve the consistency and quality of the products manufactured at his factory. So he brings in an expert, who advises him there’s a new technique called “Constant Validation” –or CV for short—that can notify him whenever a defect is found. This sounds great to the factory owner, so he decides to install CV at his factory immediately.</p>

<p>Before he leaves, the expert also informs the owner that he should have his workers stop whenever a defect is found and wait for it to be resolved before resuming work. Otherwise, tracing the defect back to its source can become very difficult, as additional errors might be introduced during the investigation. This makes a lot of sense to the factory owner; he thanks the expert for his time and bids him farewell.</p>

<p>Initially, business is going well for the factory owner. The CV system enables him to react as soon as a defect is found, taking corrective action at once to prevent further damages. For the first couple of weeks following the CV installation, he is extremely pleased with his investment.</p>

    <p>It is a well-known fact among my teammates that my tolerance for hacks is higher than most developers’. And so it is that sometimes I write code that others find horrifying.</p>

<p>Here’s one that I personally like, and which has caused more than one of my teammates to chuckle in half-approval. It came up again just today, as we are using <a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/">Padrino</a> on my current project and a coworker wanted to know if Sinatra and/or Padrino had an equivalent to the Rails console (to allow a dev to poke around the system at some arbitrary point during the program’s execution—say, in the middle of handling a request at the controller level).</p>

<p>Frankly, I’m no Sinatra expert. For all I know there <em>is</em> an equivalent to the Rails console in Sinatra. I’ve never really cared, because if I want to poke around the code mid-request I just whip up something like this, which I shall call the <strong>littlest Ruby debugger</strong>:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Start typing away."</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">STDIN</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readline</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="s2">""</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="nb">eval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">line</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Yes, yes, I know. Any developer who lets something like that slip into production code deserves to be shot. But I would honestly argue that the chances of that are so close to zero as to be completely unworthy of any serious consideration.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the above hack in action, responding to a request on my local machine (with my commands highlighted):</p>
<pre>  DEBUG -      GET (0.0120ms) /layouts/ - 200

    <p>I noticed something funny about myself this morning while making coffee.</p>
    
    <p>The kitchen in my wife’s and my apartment is divided into a main area and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scullery_(room)">scullery</a> (yep, we’re old fashioned). The scullery holds our silverware, dishes, coffee, tea, and other things. But the coffee <em>maker</em> is in the main area, on a cart.</p>
    
    <p>This morning I went into the kitchen, put a filter in the coffee maker, took the carafe and brought it with me into the scullery. In the scullery I filled the carafe with water, took the coffee and walked back to the cart in the kitchen. I filled the machine with enough water for two cups of coffee, collected an emptied sugar packet that was sitting on the cart, and tossed it into the trash on my way back to the scullery, where I poured out the excess water from the carafe and picked up a mug and a spoon before heading back to the cart.</p>
    
    <p>What I noticed about this whole procedure (after having gone through it, of course) is that I had <strong>optimized</strong> my trips to and from the scullery—not perfectly, by any means, but to some extent. That is, rather than making a trip for one purpose (e.g., filling the carafe with water), I <em>combined</em> tasks so as to reduce the total number of trips back and forth. And what was particularly noteworthy to me was that I had done this <em>without really thinking about it</em>.</p>
    
    <p>Recently I interviewed an engineer for ThoughtWorks. It was a technical phone interview, so much of the conversation was relatively high-level (I figured, save the whiteboard problems for in-office interviews). Even so, I did throw in a few problems, emphasizing to the candidate that the goal of the exercise was for her to share<span class="post-link">...

    <p>When I was younger my grandpa taught me and my sister a little trick. He said to me, “I can calculate how many hairs are on your sister’s head.” It seemed preposterous to my young mind; the number was surely so astronomical as to be beyond any intelligent guess. But I was curious.</p>

<p>What my grandpa did was to start with individual hairs. He counted 1, 2, up to ten, and held that many strands between two fingers. “This is ten,” he said. Then, using roughly that many strands now as a unit, he counted out 9 more units of similar size, collecting them between the same two fingers. He now held roughly ten times the number of hairs from before. “This,” he said, very seriously as he wanted to make sure we were paying attention, “is about a hundred.”</p>

<p>I may have been a kid, but I immediately saw where he was going. Next, he counted by approximate hundreds, covering more and more area on my sister’s head. He didn’t have to keep holding it all between his fingers; it became reasonable at a certain point (maybe 100, maybe 1000) to eyeball it.</p>

<p>Of course, I have no memory of what the actual end result was. And obviously, it was not a precisely accurate number. But there’s no doubt in my mind that it was an <strong>accurate ballpark</strong> estimate. My grandpa never studied human anatomy, but he figured out within an order of magnitude how many hairs were on my head with <strike>a minimal</strike> an <em>optimal</em> amount of effort.</p>

<p>Often, in software, ballpark estimates are exactly what we want. Particularly in your stereotypical “agile” project, where the client understands that absolute estimates are tough to produce but relative estimates are easy and that’s why we use story points, <em>yada</em><span class="post-link">...
