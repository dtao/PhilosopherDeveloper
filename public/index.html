    <p>In a footnote to <a href="/posts/making-yaml-safe-again.html">my post a while ago on SafeYAML</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, I established a goal of writing more about my many open source projects, which I have a bad habit of not telling anyone about—sometimes even long after they’re finished!</p>

<p>So today I want to write about a pretty good one that’s relatively polished and full-featured. It’s called <a href="http://dtao.github.io/HighTables/">HighTables</a>, and it’s a JavaScript library that makes adding charts to existing sites with HTML tables <em>extremely</em> easy.</p>

<p>Here, I’ll give you an example (<strong>note</strong>: this is probably not going to display properly for those of you on RSS readers; <a href="http://philosopherdeveloper.com/posts/charts-made-dead-simple-with-hightables.html">visit the website</a> to see what I’m trying to show you!):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;table</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"render-to-bar-chart"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;th&gt;</span>How easy it is to render a chart<span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;th&gt;</span>How easy it is (scale from 1 to 10)<span class="nt">&lt;/th&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Using Highcharts directly<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>3<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>Using HighTables<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;</span>10<span class="nt">&lt;/td&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/table&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>And the result:</p>
<table class="render-to-bar-chart">
<tr>
<th>How easy it is to render a chart</th>
    <th>How easy it is (scale from 1 to 10)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Using Highcharts directly</td>
    <td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Using HighTables</td>
    <td>10</td>
</tr>
</table><p>Pretty cool, right?</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, HighTables itself isn’t all that complicated. It leverages the power of two existing libraries, <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. If you don’t know about Highcharts, it’s a great library that lets you render all kinds of charts (line, area, bar, pie, etc.) in JavaScript. And if you don’t know about jQuery, and you’re a JavaScript developer, you should probably blow the dust off your keyboard and <a href="http://www.doxdesk.com/img/updates/20091116-so-large.gif">ask any JS-related question on the internet</a> to learn more about it.</p>

<p>My problem with Highcharts in the past was that it has <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts">a <em>behemoth</em> API</a>. Rendering a chart was never a simple matter of calling <code>pieChart()</code>; instead, any chart-creation logic requires a whole ton of options that an average person is <span class="post-link">...

    <p>Most people outside of the software development profession (and even many on the inside) may not realize that there is some disagreement within the community as to whether or not software development is a form of <em>engineering</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s say you placed software developers along a spectrum, where at one end “engineering” might as well be a foreign word, and at the other end writing software is <em>obviously</em> a form of engineering, in much the same way that painting or sculpture is obviously a form of art.</p>

<figure class="plain"><img src="/images/engineering-spectrum.png" alt="Is software development a form of engineering?"><figcaption>Is software development a form of engineering?</figcaption></figure>

<p>Personally, I have worked at various points along this spectrum. My first developer job was at a trading company in Philadelphia, which would have fallen pretty close to the extreme left end. At <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> I would say the culture was somewhere in the middle, with plenty of developers leaning in both directions (I definitely worked with self-professed “engineers” at ThoughtWorks, as well as individuals who vehemently rejected the label).</p>

<p>More recently I’ve worked in environments that fall much closer to the right side of the spectrum. The culture at <a href="http://www.cardpool.com">Cardpool</a>–founded by two former Microsoft employees and with its first two hires from Google—was, not surprisingly, firmly in the software-as-engineering camp. I would expect no different from most large software companies (or developers with large company roots). And a couple of weeks ago I started at Google myself, which I’m guessing will be about as far to the right as I’ll ever get in my career.</p>

<p>(By the way, it’s probably not a coincidence that I chose to assign the left and right sides of the spectrum to the viewpoints that I did; read <a href="https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz">Steve Yegge’s argument</a> that software developers fall into “liberal” and “conservative” groups to get an interesting view on a related subject.

    <p>When my wife and I moved from Philadelphia to San Francisco in 2010, we brought our espresso machine with us.</p>

<figure class="hidden-in-abbreviated-version"><img src="/images/espresso_machine_thumb.jpg" alt="Our espresso machine"><figcaption>Our espresso machine</figcaption></figure>

<p>Back in Philly, we’d had a modest kitchen with just enough counter space for the machine. On lazy weekend mornings, I’d often turn it on and prepare us each a latte drink. It was a nice little ritual.</p>

<p>So we brought it to San Francisco with us. But our first apartment, a little studio we rented from a friend of a friend, didn’t have the room for it. So the machine went into storage.</p>

<p>Then in 2011, we moved to our current apartment in the Mission. The espresso machine is back; but we don’t have quite the counter space that we did in Philadelphia, so it’s sitting on a little cart underneath our microwave, unplugged.</p>

<figure class="hidden-in-abbreviated-version"><img src="/images/espresso_machine2.jpg" alt="Our espresso machine now"><figcaption>Our espresso machine now</figcaption></figure>

<p>This isn’t terribly inconvenient. To use it, I only need to pick it up and set it somewhere—say, on our table—then put it back when I’m finished. Still, the fact remains: <strong>I haven’t used it once</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> since moving here.</p>

<p>How strange, that such a small and seemingly insignificant detail could have such a disproportionate impact on our lives! Instead of plugged in and on the counter, the espresso machine is unplugged and a few feet lower. That’s a small change. But now instead of using the machine every week or so, I <em>never</em> use it. That’s a comparatively <em>big</em> change.</p>

<p>I’ve pondered this from time to time, and an idea that keeps recurring to me is that <strong>we humans are programmable</strong>. At least to an extent. Simply by recognizing that my internal decision-making circuitry seems to ignore the espresso machine when it’s near the ground but will actually commit to using it when it’s on the counter, I can alter my behavior by <span class="post-link">...

    <p>It’s natural to think of <em>being smart</em> as an asset. This is obvious in many ways, so I don’t feel I need to enumerate them. But there are also ways that it can be a liability; and since this is the contrarian view, I naturally want to talk about it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
    
    <p>Before I start, though, a note about the word “smart”: it can mean many things. What I am specifically referring to now is what I will call raw <strong>brain power</strong>: the capacity of a person’s mind to think quickly, grasp tricky concepts, store a lot of information at once, and so on. If the mind were a computer, in other words, I’d be talking about <em>hardware</em> (CPU, memory, etc.) as opposed to software.</p>
    
    <p>The <em>software</em> of a computer system makes <em>use</em> of the hardware. It isn’t the other way around. Powerful hardware on its own is useless. For the purpose of this argument I propose that we think of being “smart”–i.e., of having a lot of brain power—as analogous to having a computer with powerful hardware. In contrast, having good instincts, solid judgment, and a fresh perspective—characteristics more in line with what we generally call “wisdom”–is like running well-written software.</p>
    
    <p>With this analogy in mind I think it makes some sense to conceptualize the brain as, quite simply, a <em>tool</em>. And framed in that way, I pose to you the question: if you were a carpenter<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and you had a top-of-the-line but rare and expensive tool—I don’t know; let’s say some custom-built <em>screwdriver</em>–would it be a wise idea to build cabinets that <em>required</em> your special tool to repair or disassemble? Or would it be better to build them with regular old screws that any ordinary screwdriver could tighten and loosen?</p>

    <h2 id="is_datamapper_inherently_broken_1">Is DataMapper inherently broken?</h2>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.drmaciver.com/2010/04/datamapper-is-inherently-broken/">strongly-worded blog post back in 2010</a>, David MacIver asserted that there is a fundamental flaw in <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a>, an ORM library for Ruby. The core of his complaint is<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that DataMapper’s default API for saving records hides errors, making it difficult to diagnose what went wrong when something fails. This in turn increases the likelihood of defects going unnoticed during development and testing, resulting in buggier software.</p>

<p>Borrowing from MacIver’s post<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, the below is a boilerplate example of how one might attempt to save a record and report any failures using DataMapper:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">my_account</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Jose"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">my_account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save</span>
  <span class="c1"># my_account is valid and has been saved</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
  <span class="n">my_account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">errors</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">e</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The above can be pretty annoying to anyone who expects conciseness from an API. Most developers don’t like the idea of having to write several lines of code just to save a record to a database.</p>

<p>Why not wrap the above into a common helper? This still won’t consistently work, as MacIvers points out with the following example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">my_account</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:customer</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="no">Customer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"jose"</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">my_account</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, an error could occur when saving <em>either</em> the <code>Account</code> object <em>or</em> the <code>Customer</code> object. And so a general-purpose helper wouldn’t be enough; one would have to write a special helper for every model, accounting for each of that model’s associations, in every application.</p>

<p>I certainly sympathize with MacIver’s frustration.</p>

<h2 id="why_use_datamapper_at_all_then_2">Why use DataMapper at all, then?</h2>

<p>It’s really a shame that such a “fundamental flaw”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> exists in DataMapper. Otherwise, I find it to be quite a nice ORM, with at least a couple of (admittedly subjective) advantages over the more popular <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activerecord">ActiveRecord</a>:</p>

<ol><li>With DataMapper, your database schema is defined in your models themselves. The ActiveRecord <span class="post-link">... (<a href="/posts/unbreaking-datamapper.html">read the full post</a>)</span>
