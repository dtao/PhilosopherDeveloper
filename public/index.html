    <p>I recently had a brief online exchange with <a href="http://matthewcopeland.me/">Matt Copeland</a>, a former coworker at ThoughtWorks, about the website <a href="http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/">shouldiuseacarousel.com</a>. It’s a fun little site presenting several bullet points against the use of carousels (rotating banners) in website UIs.</p>



<p>I’m no designer or UX expert. Over the years I’ve noticed that I <em>do</em> seem to take a greater interest in frontend-y stuff than most other developers I work with; but that’s a far cry from someone with expertise in user experience. Still, when Matt first posted a link to the carousel-bashing site I found myself responding skeptically. Of course, maybe that’s because I respond skeptically to pretty much everything that exists in this world.</p>



<p>Anyway, this shall be my attempt to explain my skepticism, concisely if I can (but knowing me, I probably can’t).</p>

    <p>My last course as a grad student at CMU was <em>Entrepreneurship for Software Engineers</em>, in which teams of students basically worked on startup ideas for one semester, sharing their progress and collecting feedback during each class session and presenting to a small group of VC reps at the end of the term. I worked on a silly little app called <a href="http://www.instapie.net">InstaPie</a>–which I haven’t touched in months (mainly because I don’t have an Apple computer anymore!), though I <em>do</em> plan to pick it back up soon, I swear—and I remember during my presentation to the VCs, one of them asked, “What problem are you trying to solve here?”</p>

<p>This wasn’t my first exposure to the question, of course. We’d been taught to always keep this question in our crosshairs, to not lose sight of the goal. Identifying the problem and proposing a solution is an important part of any elevator pitch, I hear. If you can’t answer that question, then you’ve lost your way somehow. Start retracing your steps until you get back to the place where a problem is clear and what you’re working on actually solves it.</p>

<p>It makes sense; I won’t debate that. Nonetheless, I think this mentality is too fixed in our brains. We have <strong>problem obsession</strong>: always needing to fix something, solve something. Take something <em>problematic</em> and address that, rather than just pursuing an idea for its own sake.</p>

<p>I’m reminded of this whenever I hear people discussing things like space exploration or research into seemingly sci-fi notions like wormholes, or time travel, or <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/05/31/187581614/report-of-liquid-woolly-mammoth-blood-prompts-clone-talk">cloning a woolly mammoth</a>. There’s a very practical attitude some people have about this, which is: until we’ve solved all of our <em>actual</em> problems, happening right now, here on Earth, we should put those other things on hold.<span class="post-link">...

    <p>Most of us in software (and probably in other fields) know about <strong>hero culture</strong>. It’s a concept everybody loves to hate. The term refers to an environment where individuals work in isolation and thrive on receiving sole credit for their work. This is generally perceived as leading to inflated egos and poor cooperation among developers. It’s the same phenomenon you see in professional sports, when star athletes are sometimes accused of not being good “team players” and getting greedy with the ball, wanting to be the center of attention.</p>

<p>So there are social reasons to dislike hero culture. There are plenty of practical reasons, too. One involves a principle known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a>: the more you rely on a hero, the more vulnerable you are in the event of losing him or her—e.g., if he or she is hit by a bus, or leaves for another company.</p>

<p>But you guys know me. If everybody else is going left, I’m going to go right (a highly predictable trait that <a href="http://www.skalb.com/">my friend Sameer</a> frequently reminds me of).</p>

<p>If you turn away from hero culture and sprint in the opposite direction, you’ll eventually start getting into what I’ll call <strong>Borg culture</strong>.</p>

<p>Borg culture is the antithesis of hero culture, where every individual is functionally equivalent. In a Borg culture, there is no place for glory or arrogance. There’s also no pride and no personal ownership. I would argue that this isn’t really better.</p>

<p>A while back I wrote about <a href="/posts/am-i-an-engineer.html">software engineering versus software craftsmanship</a>. In general, I think most of us would associate my description of “engineering” with what is typically done at larger corporations—less personal, more mechanical. That sounds like Borg culture. Actually, I think it’s just the opposite. Big companies are notoriously conducive to hero culture,<span class="post-link">...

    <p>I recently started a JavaScript project called <strong>Lazy.js</strong> that’s been getting quite a lot of attention. Essentially the project is a utility library in a similar vein to <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> or <a href="http://lodash.com/">Lo-Dash</a>, but with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">lazy evaluation</a> (hence the name).</p>

<p>The reason I think the project has been piquing the interest of so many JavaScript developers is that it offers the promise of some truly solid performance, even compared to Lo-Dash (which is itself highly optimized in comparison to Underscore). This chart shows the performance of Lazy.js compared to both of those libraries for several common operations on arrays of 10 elements each on Chrome:</p>

<figure class="plain"><img src="/images/lazy-performance.png" alt="Lazy.js performance versus Underscore and Lo-Dash"><figcaption>Lazy.js performance versus Underscore and Lo-Dash</figcaption></figure>

<p>You can read more about what Lazy.js <em>does</em> <a href="http://dtao.github.io/lazy.js/">on the project website</a> or in the README <a href="https://github.com/dtao/lazy.js">on its GitHub page</a>. In this blog post, I want to write a little bit about how it <em>works</em>, and what makes it different.</p>

<h2 id="a_different_paradigm_1">A different paradigm</h2>

<p>Fundamentally, Lazy.js represents a paradigm shift from the model of Underscore and Lo-Dash (starting now I’m just going to say “Underscore” for brevity), which provide a host of useful functions for what I’ll call <strong>array transformation</strong>: each function accepts an array as input, does something with it, and then gives back a new array:</p>

<figure class="plain"><img src="/images/array-transformation.png" alt="Array transformation"><figcaption>Array transformation</figcaption></figure>

<p>This isn’t how Lazy.js works. Instead, what is essentially happening at the core of Lazy.js is <strong>function composition</strong>: each function accepts a <em>function</em> as input, stores it, and gives back an object that can do the same. Then ultimately when <code>each(fn)</code> is called on the last object in the chain, it composes all of those functions together, effectively changing the behavior of <code>fn</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s take <code>map</code> as an example. The idea of <em>mapping</em> is simple and something we do all the time; it basically means <em>translating</em> or <em>converting</em>.</p>

    <p>Looking back on some of my recent posts on this blog, I’m a bit annoyed at myself for being too hand-wavy and not saying anything all that original.</p>

<p>I’d like to make an effort, at least in my next few posts, to get more concrete and challenge some of the conventions I’ve observed in the software world. I’ll start with an idea that I think is not all that radical, though it <em>would</em> mark a sigificant departure for most teams I’ve worked on.</p>

<h2 id="how_we_think_about_priority_1">How we think about priority</h2>

<p>The way most teams prioritize work seems totally sensible on the surface. Essentially, tasks are assigned some priority ranking such as “high”, “medium” or “low”; and then the highest-ranked tasks actually get assigned to people. In a perfect world this would mean that the most important things always get done, and then when there’s a surplus of time a team can “catch up” on issues that aren’t quite as urgent. In practice I think a different reality tends to emerge.</p>

<p>On projects I’ve been a part of, inevitably it turns out that the “high-priority” work is the <em>only</em> work that gets done. We never seem to run out of high-priority things to do; and so there ends up being <strong>this giant mountain of “low-priority” issues</strong> that, if we’re honest with ourselves, will never be tackled. Which would imply that more and more important things keep always coming up.</p>

<p>But either this isn’t true, or it shouldn’t be.</p>

<p>Other than the fact that it just doesn’t seem reasonable that such a curve could actually represent reality, I see two problems here. First, the accumulation of many small bugs over the life of a project brings the quality of the software down, which is a sad state of affairs. Have you ever encountered a<span class="post-link">...
