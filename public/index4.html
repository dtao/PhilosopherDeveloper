    <h1 id="starting_with_an_outline_1">Starting with an outline</h1>

<p>More than one of my high school English teachers taught us that when you’re writing a paper, you should start by making an outline of your high-level points. This way, they told us, you would have a “skeleton” paper already written, which you could then “flesh out” by filling in appropriate details here and there.</p>

<p>I never much internalized this process of starting off with an outline. I wish I had.</p>

<h1 id="to_design_or_assemble_2">To design or assemble</h1>

<p>My first project at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> was in Dallas, TX. During a car ride back to the office after lunch one day, I was having a conversation with Billy, one of the client company’s developers; and he mentioned that he had recently been to a Google conference to learn about <a href="https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a> (one of the technologies we were using on the project), among other things. I can’t recall everything we talked about, but something that Billy said during that conversation has stuck with me ever since:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple—they are the LEGO makers. We are just the assemblers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time, I strongly disagreed with Billy on this point. Part of me wanted to blurt out, “Speak for yourself!” I didn’t say that, of course; in fact I wasn’t even sure why I felt so strongly in opposition to this statement. Probably more than any other reason, I was just feeling defensive against what I felt was a belittling thing to say about being a software developer.</p>

<p>What I <em>did</em> say was something to the effect that we are all LEGO makers in the sense that we should strive to write clean code, to design clear interfaces, to build reusable components, etc. Billy smiled but clearly didn’t agree with me. In retrospect, he probably thought I was being naïve.</p><span class="post-link">... (<a href="/posts/optimize-for-comprehensibility.html">read the full post</a>)</span>

    <p>Recently my friend Chuck reminded me of a conversation he and I had ages ago about a company called <a href="http://steorn.com/">Steorn</a>. This is a company that publicly claimed, back in 2007, to have developed an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overunity">overunity</a> technology. Chuck chastised me for having persuaded him to take the company seriously; to this day, despite their refusal to back down, they have still not convincingly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics">broken the second law of thermodynamics</a>.</p>

<p>Most of my acquaintances with a modest amount of scientific knowledge, of course, dismissed Steorn from the very start. What the company claims to do violates a known law of physics, they argued; therefore it is impossible; therefore they are either lying or confused. Personally, I never did and probably never will fully sympathize with this attitude. While I agree that Steorn probably do not have what they have claimed (and I certainly have no intention of arguing with the laws of thermodynamics!), I disagree with the premise that we can be <em>so sure</em> of things like this that we are justified in rejecting them immediately.</p>

<p>This is actually the same topic I covered in <a href="http://philosopherdeveloper.wordpress.com/2009/12/19/the-myth-of-the-myth-of-perpetual-motion/">my very first post on this blog</a>. But it’s something I feel quite strongly about, so I’ll probably write about it again, and again, until I’m satisfied I’ve fully covered the topic in the way I want (i.e., never). This time around, I want to relate my skepticism in these sorts of matters to the concept of <em>one-way-functions</em>–a mathematical term that I’ll define later in this post. But first, I’ll start with a simple problem.</p>

<h2 id="recognizing_patterns_1">Recognizing patterns</h2>

<p>Back in the old K–12 days, I remember sometimes taking tests with <em>pattern recognition</em> questions. As a kid, I was always frustrated by these questions because I felt that they generally had no right answer.<span class="post-link">...

    <p>I read an article in the New York Times recently entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/opinion/nocera-has-apple-peaked.html">Has Apple Peaked?</a> and found myself nodding my head to a lot of the author’s points. The basic premise of the article was this: <em>maybe</em> Apple has peaked, and maybe it isn’t because Steve Jobs has passed away but rather because, as a company on top of the world, they now have everything to lose and can no longer take big risks.</p>

<p>I think there’s something to this, and I’d add another source of inertia for consideration: <strong>hubris</strong> (big surprise to those of you familiar with my general dislike for Apple, I’m sure!). At Apple’s scale, given the massive success they’ve enjoyed over the past several years, I have no doubt that the company’s sense of self-importance is extraordinarily high. Which is obviously justified to a significant degree. But one common observation I have about human nature—and I am increasingly convinced that it applies to businesses the same way it applies to individuals—is that it is very easy to pat yourself on the back for a job well done and claim more credit for your success than you <em>really</em> deserve. Put another way: it can be very easy to miss what an important role <em>luck</em> has played in your life, and thus to take full credit for your good fortune.</p>

<p>Which means that if you’re a company like Apple, you start to get complacent. You watch every product you release hit record-breaking sales, you see your competitors struggling to gain any kind of momentum, you notice the lines stretching for blocks outside every one of your retail stores, and… you start to relax. You think, <em>no one can touch us right now</em>. You feel invincible. You take for granted that everything you do is ground-breaking. Of course it<span class="post-link">...

    <h1 id="preamble_1">Preamble</h1>

<p>As I’m sure plenty of you already know (the title of this blog is a bit of a giveaway), I was a <strong>philosophy</strong> major in college. Which means I was <em>not</em> a C.S. major. But that’s not the full extent of it: I didn’t <em>minor</em> in C.S., either; I actually took <em>absolutely no computer sciences courses at all</em> in college.</p>

<p>I did recently receive an M.S. in software engineering from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/">Carnegie Mellon</a>; but the courses in that program were higher-level in nature: software architecture, process management, software metrics, entrepreneurship—that sort of thing. And so I’ve still never really had an academic foundation for a lot of the more theoretical stuff that those with bachelor’s degrees in computer science have.</p>

<p>To clarify: I <em>do</em> know a decent amount of C.S. stuff in practice, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>I worked for two years at an algorithmic trading company, where performance was a key concern (use of optimal data structures was critical) and the software was highly concurrent (so I got plenty of hands-on experience with things like synchronization, mutexes, semaphores, etc.)</li>

<li>I am a huge nerd who spends way too much time reading about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list">skip lists</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_black_tree">red-black trees</a> and all that good stuff on Wikipedia</li>
</ul><p>Anyway, all this is my long-winded way of introducing a little series of blog posts I’m going to be doing, starting with this one. The basic idea behind it should already be obvious: I’m going to “brush up” on (in some cases, learn entirely from scratch) some of the fun theoretical stuff that I missed by never going through a college C.S. program.</p>

<p>Those of you already well-versed with theoretical C.S. stuff will probably not be all that intrigued by this or the next few posts. Then again, maybe you will. My goal is actually two-fold here:</p><ol><li><span class="post-link">... (<a href="/posts/brushing-up-on-cs-part-1-algorithmic-complexity.html">read the full post</a>)</span></li></ol>

    <p>Today I felt like writing something more low-level than I’ve written in a while… and since C# is about the lowest I go (yeah, pretty sad—I haven’t really earned my beard yet), that will be my language of choice for this post.</p>

<p>But we start with JavaScript, actually. A couple of months ago, shortly after joining <a href="http://www.cardpool.com/">Cardpool</a>–a topic <em>definitely</em> deserving of its own post, in due time—I started working on a top-secret new project. Without giving too much away (as if it really matters), I’ll just say that my work on this project involved writing a library to process a sequence of data from an input device which emulated a computer keyboard. Essentially this input sequence would ultimately be interpreted as a string; but unlike your typical scenario of taking user input from, e.g., a text field—where the string is given to you all at once—in this case the library had to <em>assemble</em> the string from bytes fed to it one-by-one.</p>

<p>In a language like Java or C# (or even Ruby), this would be totally easy, albeit unconventional. The data structure for a string is <a href="/posts/are-strings-really-immutable-in-net.html">more or less</a> immutable in Java and C#, but both have the concept of a mutable <code>StringBuilder</code> for precisely the case where you need to construct a string by concatenating many segments. And in Ruby, strings are mutable to begin with (you use the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator to append to an existing string).</p>

<p>But this library I was working on was in <em>JavaScript</em>–a language that I love, but one without any specialized options for concatenating strings quickly. JavaScript strings are immutable, and there is no concept of a <code>StringBuilder</code>. If you want to concatenate many strings together, you have two options:</p>

<ul>
<li>The good ol’ <code>+=</code> operator</li>

<li>Storing the elements in an array, and<span class="post-link">... (<a href="/posts/magical-optimization-of-the-%2B%3D-operator-with-strings.html">read the full post</a>)</span>
