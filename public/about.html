    <p>I was a Philosophy major in college, but I’ve been a software developer since 2009.</p>

<p>In 2012 I graduated from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley">CMU Silicon Valley</a> with an M.S. in Software Engineering. As my final project as a grad student, I developed <a href="http://www.instapie.net">InstaPie</a>, a fun way to settle arguments with friends.</p>

<p>For about a year I worked at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>, which was a really great experience. It seems almost every day I apply lessons I learned from my brilliant coworkers there to my current job.</p>

<p>Now I’m an engineer at <a href="http://www.cardpool.com">Cardpool</a>, an online exchange for pre-paid gift cards.</p>

<p>Most of my experience is in .NET (particularly C#), Ruby, and JavaScript. I can also find my way around Java, Objective-C, Python, or PHP relatively well; and I have a bit of a soft spot for VB.NET! I guess I would describe myself as a “generalist,” eager to pick up new technologies whenever I can find a good excuse to.</p>

<p>I also like to pretend I have any idea what I’m talking about when it comes to C++ (but to be honest, I totally don’t).</p>
