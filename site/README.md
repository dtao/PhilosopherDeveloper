# Site builder

The contents of this directory are a bare bones library for building the site
where the blog is hosted. The goal is to have as close to zero dependencies as
possible and to take a YAGNI approach. Eventually this will replace the current
build based on [Middleman][1].

Features:

- [x] Render all posts
- [x] Render index page
- [x] Render "All posts" page
- [x] Render "About" page
- [x] Render images as figures
- [x] Ensure syntax highlighting is working
- [x] Ensure custom CSS & JS are working
- [x] Ensure footnotes are working
- [x] Ensure tables are working
- [ ] Ensure "Subscribe" form is working
- [ ] Enable social sharing
- [ ] Enable Disqus comments
