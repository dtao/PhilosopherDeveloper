Here are some things I think we take for granted that might be worth reconsidering.

Prioritization of work
----------------------

The way most teams prioritize work seems totally sensible. Essentially, tasks are assigned some priority ranking such as "high", "medium" or "low"; and then the highest-ranked tasks actually get assigned to people. In a perfect world this would mean that the most important things always get done, and then when there's a surplus of time a team can "catch up" on issues that aren't quite as urgent. In practice I think a different reality tends to emerge.

On projects I've worked on, inevitably there is this giant mountain of "low-priority" issues that, if we're honest with ourselves, will never be tackled. Which would imply that the team must always be stretched thin and constantly working on higher-priority items. But either this isn't true, or it shouldn't be.

There are at least two big problems with this. First, the accumulation of many small bugs over the life of a project brings the quality of the software down, which is a sad state of affairs. Have you ever encountered a bug for the Nth time in some application you use regularly, and suddenly it occurred to you that that bug has been around *forever*? Arguably even worse is the technical debt that so many low-priority defects represent. Choosing to almost plow forward with high-priority items while allowing all these little problems to pile up induces drag on a team. It becomes harder to make forward progress.

Similarly, there are two mistakes that lead to this predicament. The first is a classic mistake most of us are at least subconsciously already aware of, which is that we get too fixated on *adding features* to software when there are still minor issues to resolve. Quite simply, fixing bugs isn't sexy. The other mistake is more psychological.

I can't really prove this, but it's my hypothesis that on strictly priority-based projects our minds come to think of *priority* as *likelihood of actually getting done*. If something *definitely* needs to get done, we'll say it's high priority to ensure that actually happens. The result is a plethora of supposedly high-priority items that are completely inconsistent in terms of urgency.
