- idea of old, temperamental server
- old hardware problem largely gone
  - servers anonymous, managed by someone else (e.g. Amazon)
  - problem of scale solved by simply adding hardware
  - "lever" system the dream of architects/execs
    - show Heroku: https://www.heroku.com/pricing
    - show AppHarbor: https://appharbor.com/pricing
- same dream applied to engineers
  - iOS example: OSX developers brought in to speed up job
  - Mythical Man Month
  - but dream remains: want to add manpower as necessary to meet objectives
- for larger companies: seems unavoidable to *some* extent
  - people will come and go
  - solid, well-defined policies, conventions, approved technologies, etc. for predictability
  - good documentation and onboarding process for dealing w/ employee turnover
  - consistent process, culture for employee "liquidity", ability to transition between teams

- for smaller companies:
  - problem with this mentality
  - say you want "the best people", coming from premium mindset
  - discrepancy between hiring demands and actual needs
  - people-as-resources means you should be striving for *value*, not quality
  - think like Google: commodity hardware gives better CPU power per $
- rebuttal:
  - personally i disagree with the sentiment
  - best people easily worth 10x "average" people
  - yet conventions, processes, etc. largely exist to equalize value - to facilitate lever system
  - equalize means lift worse people up, drag better people down
  - so why attempt this when you are aiming to only hire best people?
  - big-company structures are specifically in place because of this scalability/value mindset

maybe leave this part off...

- how i would (will?) run a company:
  - best people are the ones you want to give the most autonomy to (just ask Daniel Pink)
  - firstly, top-of-market salary should be given
    - golden rule: treat others how you want to be treated
    - if goal is to get good "value" from individuals (by negotiating lower salary),
      they will have same goal for the job and just leave once they've learned what
      they could
  - freedom should be maximized, product ideas encouraged
- not to be confused with democratic system
  - actually deeply skeptical of group-based decision-making
  - again: individuals should be as *autonomous* as possible
