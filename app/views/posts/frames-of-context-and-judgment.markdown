Consider this point:

![A point with no context](/images/point-without-context.png)

Where is it? To answer that question we need some frame of *context*, or reference. For example, we could define a plane that the point lies in, with X and Y axes. Let's do that:

[!A point on a coordinate system](/images/point-on-coordinate-system.png)

Now we have context. The point is at (5, 5).

Contexts are mutable
--------------------

But wait, is the point really at (5, 5)? Or is it just *somewhere*, and we overlaid a set of axes on top of it? Clearly--in this case at least, since I'm the one writing this!--it's the latter. We could just as easily draw the context like this:

[!Same point, different coordinate system](/images/point-on-different-coordinate-system.png)

Now the point is "at" (100, 100).

The lesson here is that the context we bring to something affects how we perceive it. This example was abstract, but the principle applies to all kinds of things. But we all know that already, right? Sure--but it's easy to forget it, or to fail to recognize where it applies, especially when the "point" is something we feel strongly about.

Contexts are necessary for judgment

I recently had a brief[^and-i-mean-brief] online exchange with [Matt Copeland](http://matthewcopeland.me/), a former coworker at ThoughtWorks, about the website [shouldiuseacarousel.com](http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/). It's a fun little site presenting several bullet points against the use of carousels in website UIs--ironically, itself using a carousel (to drive home the point, I guess).

I'm no designer or UX expert. Experience has shown me that I *do* seem to take a greater interest in frontend-y stuff than most other developers I work with; but that's a far cry from someone with expertise in user experience. Still, when Matt first posted a link to the carousel-bashing site I found myself responding skeptically. (To be fair, maybe that's because I respond skeptically to pretty much everything that exists in this world.)

Of the 6 references presented on the site, 4 of them explicitly mention "clicking" or user interaction of some kind. Already, to me, this was evidence of a potential skew in perception. I've never thought of carousels as being great for user interaction.

[^and-i-mean-brief]: As in, literally about 2 Tweets each.
