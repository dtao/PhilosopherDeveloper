This will likely end up as the precursor to a much longer and more well-thought-out post; but the idea has been floating around in my head for long enough that I think it's time to at least get down what I have so far.

I was partially motivated to write this post by [Martin's Fowler's recent article](http://martinfowler.com/articles/eliminatingSalesCommissions) explaining why ThoughtWorks has stopped paying sales commissions. Fog Creek made [a similar move](http://blog.fogcreek.com/why-do-we-pay-sales-commissions) just recently as well.

Fowler provides several reasons for the change; but if I had to summarize them in one sentence I'd say it all comes down to aligning *ends* rather than *means*.

This is how I see it. I, like a significant portion of my fellow software nerds--particularly out here in Silicon Valley--think I might like to start a business one day. And so I've put some thought into what goes into that. Obviously there are many factors, most of which I'm completely oblivious of as I haven't actually *done* it yet. But one thing I am sure always holds true is that you must have some *reason* for starting a business. Maybe there's a problem you're trying to solve; maybe there's some awesome new product you think will make people's lives better, or more efficient, or just more fun. But there must be a reason.

**Profit**[^or-revenue] itself is not a reason. Profitability is a *requirement* of running a sustainable business; but on its own, it is not an *end*--it is a *means*. And so part of the issue with paying sales commissions is that it aligns salespeople's incentives with the company's only insofar as it drives them toward meeting *one of the company's requirements*. But focusing exclusively on this requirement may actually be at odds with the company's longer-term goals, i.e. the whole reason for its existence.

Here's a parallel. Eating food is necessary to live; it is a means. But if you confused this with an *end*, you might decide to devote all your time to eating. This would then lead to obesity, which would *reduce* your life expectancy and thereby consitute self-defeating behavior.

Similarly, companies can (and often do) make the mistake of viewing *profit* as an *end goal*[^profit-can-be-a-goal]. I view this is not all that different from my overeating example: fixating on profit leads to obsessive behavior geared towards maximizing revenues in the immediate future, which will often damage the company's health over time. The company may alienate its customers, or its employees, or opt for short-term strategies with negative long-term trade-offs.

But here's what I think is the most important part of this discussion. The following comes the Fog Creek article:

Which brings me to a seemingly different but related topic: namely, how companies recruit software engineers.

I think there's a strange disconnect, in Silicon Valley especially, between how much priority companies place on finding "great" engineers, and how these individuals are viewed once they've been hired. Part of this simply boils down to the common word we use so casually to describe people who are hired by a business: **resources**. I have an idea for a tech company; I need help implementing it, so I seek funding to help me get the resources to build my idea. It's such a simple concept. But by viewing people in this way, we *immediately* separate the company's people from its higher-level goals.

This seems to be particularly pervasive in Silicon Valley, in part because we "engineers"[^engineers] totally eat it up. Much like an excited child after receiving a blue ribbon, I think many engineers love to be valued and compared as resources. There's something vaguely concrete[^vaguely-concrete] about it, the idea that I make this salary, I build this much, and so I provide X value.



[^or-revenue]: The same holds true for revenue.

[^profit-can-be-a-goal]: I don't mean to imply that profit can't be *a* goal. Setting intermediate goals (like profit) as a way to keep on track towards a larger goal is a practical thing to do. I just want to emphasize that intermediate goals should be mistaken for *end* goals.

[^engineers]: Which, by the way, is not even an accurate term for most of us. But that's an entirely different topic!

[^vaguely-concrete]: Or is that an oxymoron?
