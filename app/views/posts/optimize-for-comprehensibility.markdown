Some high-level notes...

- high school English, learning to write outline before paper

- first project at ThoughtWorks
  - Billy's comment: "They are the LEGO-makers, we are the assemblers"
    - disagreed, but not sure why (just defensive?)
  - Yujun's refactoring habits

- now at Cardpool
  - complimented on "code sight-reading"--similar meaning as w/ music
  - discussion w/ Robby on lots of little methods vs. procedural code

- where it all comes together for me: *I Am a Strange Loop* by Hofstadter
  - quote about comprehensibility
  - low-level details both necessary and irrelevant

- Kathryn talking about people telling stories, getting down in the weeds
  - lesson: cater your delivery to people's interest level
  - allow the audience to explore the content you're revealing

- circle back to code
  - absolutely prefer smaller methods
  - Pete's comment: maintain a consistent level of abstraction
  - good code should read like good prose? NO--like Wikipedia!
  - allow the reader to "drill down" as far as he/she likes

- it is often said "optimize for readability"; but I say: "optimize for comprehensibility"

- closing remark: we should all be like LEGO builders, in the sense that what we create can be taken
  apart, modified, repurposed... but most of all: comprehended
