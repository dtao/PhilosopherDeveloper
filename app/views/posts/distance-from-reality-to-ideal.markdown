The distance between reality and the ideal

- phrase in software: "pit of success"
  - embraces the principle of not expecting too much from developers
  - requires pit to be "nearby"

- Google exercise on "think big" w/ brain naturally moving in small increments

- developers who "get" paradigm shifts want to see them become widespread
  - too far from current reality, pit of success not close
  - so how do we get to it? small steps (you can expect *something* from developers, just not much)

- example: PHP
  - distance from "don't know how to code" to "web server + Ruby + Rails + git + Bundler + Heroku" VERY BIG
  - in contrast, "upload code via FTP to host" much simpler

- example: Functional programming in OO languages
  - full paradigm shift to functional programming i.e. Clojure, Haskell, etc. pretty extreme
  - ease developers into functional concepts w/ delegate & lambdas (C#), anonymous functions (JavaScript),
    blocks (Ruby), even Java libraries like Guava -- much more doable

- example: Bootstrap
  - criticized for promoting "non-semantic markup"
  - ideal would be semantic markup, style + layout fully extracted to CSS
  - many developers are not ready to think in abstract terms of data vs. presentation, view HTML as
    a means for creating a UI (which to be fair, it is), appreciate ready-made components

- key lesson from these examples: when reality and ideal are far apart, start closer to reality

- are these things good, or will they need to be replaced? doesn't matter--they will work, for now.
  and either they will evolve and slowly drag developers closer to ideal, or they will be replaced
