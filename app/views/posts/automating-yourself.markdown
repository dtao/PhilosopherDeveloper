When my wife and I moved from Philadelphia to San Francisco in 2010, we brought our espresso machine with us.

Back in Philly, we'd had a modest kitchen with just enough counter space for the machine. On lazy weekend mornings, I'd often turn it on and prepare us each a latte drink. It was a nice little ritual.

So we brought it to San Francisco with us. But our first apartment, a little studio we rented from a friend of a friend, didn't have the room for it. So the machine went into storage.

Then in 2011, we moved to our current apartment in the Mission. The espresso machine is back; but we don't have quite the counter space that we did in Philadelphia, so it's sitting on a little cart underneath our microwave, unplugged.

This isn't terribly inconvenient. To use it, I only need to pick it up and set it somewhere--say, on our table--then put it back when I'm finished. Still, the fact remains: **I haven't used it once**[^unused-espresso-machine] since moving here.

How strange, that such a small and seemingly insignificant detail could have such a disproportionate impact on our lives! Instead of plugged in and on the counter, the espresso machine is unplugged and a few feet lower. That's a small change. But now instead of using the machine every week or so, I *never* use it. That's a comparatively *big* change.

Our programmable selves
-----------------------

I've pondered this from time to time, and an idea that keeps recurring to me is that **we humans are programmable**. At least to an extent. Simply by recognizing that my internal decision-making circuitry seems to ignore the espresso machine when it's near the ground but will actually commit to using it when it's on the counter, I can alter my behavior by changing its location.

It's a silly example, but I think this is actually a really important point. The distinction here is essentially the difference between *manual* and *automatic* processes. We are most effective when we are able to automate the things we do; that much is obvious. But getting software or robots to do all of our grunt work for us isn't the only kind of automation. I would define[^definition] automation as the act of replacing any process requiring manual input with one that does not, but yields acceptable (often better) results.

A few years ago, a friend asked me to help him out with an idea for a software product. I offered to help without payment, but he insisted on paying me. He explained that if he paid me, he knew I would force myself to do the work. Otherwise, I might view our agreement as little more than me doing him a favor, in which case I'd be more likely to drag my feet. Cynical or not, it was a totally legitimate view, and another perfect example of what I'm talking about. Effectively my friend wanted to replace a *manual* process--me consciously taking the time to help out a friend--with an *automatic* one--me responding to an internal, and basically involuntary, sense of obligation.

This kind of self-programming is hugely powerful, and is something I think we need to spend more time thinking about.

How we get it wrong
-------------------

An interesting obstacle to self-automation that I've noticed among people I've worked with is the tendency to **value manual effort**. We appreciate when others take the time to stop what they're doing and help us with something. And so there's a sense of pride that comes with being asked to help out somewhere. We all love to feel needed, after all.

This makes it very easy to miss cases when the effort we spend is actually wasteful.

Imagine that my espresso machine were incredibly heavy, so heavy that I couldn't even lift it. And suppose I had some much stronger friend who was capable of lifting it. Then whenever my friend was around and I was in the mood for some espresso, I would ask him to pick up the machine and put it on the table for me, so I could plug it in and use it. This arrangement might feel good to my friend as it would make him feel useful.

[^unused-espresso-machine]: That actually isn't the full story. The real reason I *still* haven't used it is that there's a part that we apparently lost somewhere between Philadelphia and here. But I've only included this detail in a footnote because it doesn't really change my argument; I only even *noticed* this part was missing after we'd already been in our new apartment for several months. So it's clear that I am not using the machine nearly as often as I used to. In addition, I'm hoping that by writing this post I will motivate myself to finally order a replacement for that part!

[^definition]: And don't bother pointing me to an actual dictionary definition; I tend to be fairly dismissive of such things. But that's a topic for a future post!
