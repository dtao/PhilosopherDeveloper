A few years ago my parents gave me and my wife an unusual Christmas present:

![The Shun Classic Utility Knife](/images/shun-utility-knife.jpg)

We weren't quite sure what to make of it at first, but it wasn't long before we both loved it. It is a *very* sharp knife, which makes it a breeze to cut through just about anything. We loved it so much, in fact, that after our wedding we decided to purchase an entire set of Shun knives.

Being someone who previously never would have thought about dropping a hefty sum of money on a set of *knives*, I can honestly say they make a huge difference. Of course there is the immediate benefit of just being able to cut up fruits and vegetables faster. But there are also intangible advantages to using sharp knives. They make it more *enjoyable* to prepare food. Which is actually a [much more important difference](/posts/automating-yourself.html).

But let me rewind a bit. Shortly after receiving the original knife, I was cutting up an avocado and made a **crucial mistake**. The knife slipped in my hand and I cut my finger quite badly. We were living in Namibia at the time, in a rural village quite a distance from any medical care; so there wasn't anything to do other than bandage the wound quickly and hope for it to heal.
