When my wife and I moved from Philadelphia to San Francisco in 2010, we brought our espresso machine with us.

Back in Philly, we'd had a modest kitchen with just enough counter space for the machine. On lazy weekend mornings, I'd often turn it on and prepare us each a latte drink. It was a nice little ritual.

So we brought it to San Francisco with us. But our first apartment, a little studio rented to us by a friend of a friend, didn't have the room for it. So the machine went into storage.

Then in 2011, we moved to our current apartment in the Mission. The espresso machine is back; but we don't have quite the counter space that we did in Philadelphia, so it's sitting on a little cart underneath our microwave, unplugged.

Of course, this isn't terribly inconvenient; to use it, I only need to pick it up and set it somewhere--say, on our table--then put it back when I'm finished. Still, the fact remains: I haven't used it once[^unused-espresso-machine].

How strange, that such a small and seemingly insignificant detail (the location of the espresso machine: plugged in and on the counter as opposed to unplugged and just a few feet lower) can have such a disproportionate impact on our lives (using the machine every week or so compared to *never* using it).

I've pondered this from time to time, and an idea that seems to keep recurring to me is that **we humans are programmable**. At least to an extent. Simply by recognizing that my internal decision-making circuitry seems to ignore the espresso machine when it's near the ground but will actually commit to using it when it's on the counter, I can alter my behavior by changing the machine's location.

It's a silly example, but I think this is actually a really important point. The distinction that I particularly want to highlight in this case is that between *manual* and *automatic* processes. We are most effective when we are able to *automate* processes rather than performing them manually. This sounds obvious; but I'm not just talking about getting software or robots to do all of our grunt work for us. I'm also talking about processes that we ourselves carry out, but in a way that we can predict and control.



[^unused-espresso-machine]: That actually isn't the full story. The real reason I *still* haven't used it is that there's a part that we apparently lost somewhere between Philadelphia and here. But I've only included this detail in a footnote because it doesn't really change my argument; I only even *noticed* this part was missing after we'd already been in our new apartment for several months. So it's clear that I am not using the machine nearly as often as I used to. In addition, I'm hoping that by writing this post I will motivate myself to finally order a replacement for that part!
