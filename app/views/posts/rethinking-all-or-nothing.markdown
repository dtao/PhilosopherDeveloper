- generic statement: i want all or nothing
  - seem reasonable?
  - we all know life consists of many compromises: what holds society together
- but in business, we applaud those who are unwilling to accept this
  - competitors must be defeated
  - purity of vision and all that
- curiously, we also value consistency without question
  - company culture
  - technology stack
  - methodology and conventions
- any software professional who's honest will admit any approach has pros and cons
- example: pair programming is great
  - better quality
  - organic knowledge sharing
  - focus
- BUT sometimes working alone for stretches of time can be awesome too
  - more freedom to dig in and experiment
  - greater sense of ownership
- so why not do both: switch back and forth?
  - benefits of both, plus exposure to alternate methods can be educational
- another example: dogfooding
  - using your own product: great way to feel pain points and understand what features would be
    most useful and what defects are most urgent
  - using competitor's product: provides insight into what others do well, might also highlight
    blind spots
- yet another: technology stack
  - sticking to a fixed set of technologies develops depth of knowledge and expertise
  - but: can lead to rigid perspective, ignorance of alternative (and sometimes superior)
    technologies
  - plus learning new stuff makes team happy and, frankly, better
- so rather than thinking in such strict terms: we do pair programming, or we dogfood religiously,
  or we use technologies XY&Z, maybe: we alternate, we try everything, we're always tinkering with
  new things
- maybe we like consistency because it's comfortable
- maybe being comfortable is the last thing we should be striving for in tech
