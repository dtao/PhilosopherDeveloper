Most of us in software (and probably in other fields) know about **hero culture**. It's a concept we all love to hate. The term refers to an environment where individuals work in isolation and thrive on receiving sole credit for their work. This is generally perceived as leading to inflated egos and poor cooperation among developers. It's the same phenomenon you see in sports, when star athletes are sometimes accused of not being good "team players" and getting greedy with the ball, wanting to be the center of attention.

So there are social reasons to dislike hero culture. There are plenty of practical reasons, too. One involves a principle known as the [bus factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor): the more you rely on a hero, the more vulnerable you are in the event of losing him or her--e.g., if he or she is hit by a bus, or leaves for another company.

But you guys know me. If everybody else is going left, I'm going to go right (a highly predictable trait that [my friend Sameer](http://www.skalb.com/) frequently reminds me of).

If you turn away from hero culture and sprint in the opposite direction, you'll eventually start getting into what I'll call **Borg culture**.

Borg culture is the antithesis of hero culture, where every individual is functionally equivalent. In a Borg culture, there is no place for glory or arrogance. There's also no pride and no personal ownership. I would argue that this isn't really better.

A while back I wrote about [software engineering versus software craftsmanship](/posts/am-i-an-engineer.html). In general, I think most of us would associate my description of "engineering" with what is typically done at larger corporations--less personal, more mechanical. That sounds like Borg culture. Actually, I think it's just the opposite. Big companies are actually notoriously conducive to hero culture, because they have a tendency to become large and bloated, teeming with mediocrity. This encourages above-average individuals to rise above the fray and get a lot of recognition just for not being terrible.

I suspect many of us have been in that situation at least once or twice. It can be a nice feeling, to have everyone impressed with you for something that really wasn't so hard. It's a dangerous place to be in, though, because after a while you get comfortable and stop improving. Without data to back it up, I nonetheless feel confident in saying that this happens all the time to "engineers" at big companies.

Counterintuitively, I see those who fall much closer to the "craftsman" end of the spectrum often succumb to the allure of Borg culture. On first glance that doesn't make any sense. But I stand by the claim, for at least two reasons:

1. A craftsman (in my personal, egregiously over-generalized opinion) is more humble. He is likely to reject labels like "hero" or "rock star" (gross) and downplay his own talents.
2. Craftsmen put a lot of stock in practices that emphasize collaboration and minimize the importance of personal *ability*: pair programming, TDD, CI, etc. These so-called "agile" methods embrace the inevitability of mistakes and focus on solving problems iteratively. There is a humility to this mindset as well.

Some of the outcomes of Borg culture are commonly viewed in a positive light, but I believe it would be wise to consider them more critically. One example is **collective code ownership**. Agile teams often sing the praises of this idea that we're all responsible for the all of the code. That can be a great thing, inasmuch as it encourages each of us to follow the [Boy Scout Rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule) happily fix one another's bugs.
