Most of us in software (and probably in other fields) know of **hero culture** as a concept that's very popular to hate. The term refers to an environment where individuals work in isolation and accept, even expect, sole credit for their work. This is generally perceived as leading to inflated egos and poor cooperation among developers. It's the same phenomenon you see in sports, when star athletes are sometimes accused of not being good "team players" and getting greedy with the ball, wanting to be the center of attention, etc.

So there are social reasons to dislike hero culture. There are plenty of practical reasons, too. One involves a principle known as the [bus factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor): the more you rely on a hero, the more vulnerable you are in the event of losing him or her (e.g., to another company, or if he or she is hit by a bus).

But you guys know me. If everybody else prefers A over B by default, that just makes me want to take a closer look at B (a very predictable trait that [my friend Sameer](http://www.skalb.com/) frequently reminds me of).

If you turn away from hero culture and sprint in the opposite direction, you'll eventually start getting into what I'll call **Borg culture**: the antithesis of hero culture, where every individual is functionally equivalent. In a Borg culture, every individual is equally responsible for every part of the code, and no one claims credit for anything. I would argue that this isn't really better.

I will just embrace my own predictability and propose that the ideal lies somewhere in the middle. Let me give you two real-world examples: one of hero culture, one of Borg culture.
