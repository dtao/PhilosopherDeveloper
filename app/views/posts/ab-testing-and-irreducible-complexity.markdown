I was raised in a pretty devout Christian family. I wouldn't describe my parents as biblical literalists--I never heard either of my parents argue with any passion for a [Young Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_earth), for example--but I still experienced some inner friction when, in ninth grade, I learned about Darwin's theory of evolution. This led me to pursue at that age a thorough understanding of both sides of the issue: on the one hand, the view that the full variety of life we see on Earth all developed through a process called *natural selection*; and on the other, that life on Earth is either partially or entirely the result of some form of *intelligent design*.

In the course of my research (obviously very rigorous and scholarly, given that I was a whopping 15 years old) on this topic, I happened to read the book [*Darwin's Black Box*](http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Black-Box-Biochemical-Challenge/dp/0743290313) by Michael Behe. This was a long time ago, so I won't claim to remember the book well enough to give a totally accurate synopsis; but the core argument of the book was that there are systems within modern organisms that are *irreducibly complex* with respect to Darwinian natural selection. These systems, according to Behe, comprise parts that individually would be detrimental to an organism; and only taken *together* do they serve some useful purpose.

To understand how this is an argument against strict Darwinism, remember the traditional view for evolution: that random mutations ocassionally give rise to traits that are beneficial to individuals' reproductive success; and over a period of billions of years, the sum total of countless such small mutations has led to all of the life that now exists. This is an *incremental* process, where
