I'm a software developer with experience building web and mobile applications in Ruby, JavaScript, .NET, Java, and Objective-C.

I originally studied Philosophy at [Duke](http://duke.edu/), then entered the software development profession shortly after graduating in 2007.

In 2008, my wife and I joined [WorldTeach](http://worldteach.org/) and spent the year teaching English in [Namibia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia). It's a beautiful country with many wonderful cultures, and I would recommend it to anyone.

In 2009 we returned to the States, where I began work at a trading firm in Philadelphia (.NET). Eventually we moved to San Francisco in 2010, where I entered the Software Engineering program at [CMU Silicon Valley](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley).

While at CMU I also worked at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com) (Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Objective-C), a software consultancy full of amazing people. I later worked at [Cardpool](http://www.cardpool.com) (Ruby on Rails), an online exchange for pre-paid gift cards.

Currently I work at Google, on the Ads team (Java, JavaScript).
