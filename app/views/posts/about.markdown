I was a Philosophy major in college, but I've been a software developer since 2009.

In 2012 I graduated from [CMU Silicon Valley](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley) with an M.S. in Software Engineering. As my final project as a grad student, I developed [InstaPie](http://www.instapie.net), a fun way to settle arguments with friends.

For about a year I worked at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com), which was a really great experience. It seems almost every day I apply lessons I learned from my brilliant coworkers there to my current job.

Now I'm an engineer at [Cardpool](http://www.cardpool.com), an online exchange for pre-paid gift cards.

Most of my experience is in .NET (particularly C#), Ruby, and JavaScript. I can also find my way around Java, Objective-C, Python, or PHP relatively well; and I have a bit of a soft spot for VB.NET! I guess I would describe myself as a "generalist," eager to pick up new technologies whenever I can find a good excuse to.

I also like to pretend I have any idea what I'm talking about when it comes to C++ (but to be honest, I totally don't).
