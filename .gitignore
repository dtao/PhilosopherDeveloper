# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
# git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the build directory
/build

# Also ignore the source/javascripts/lib directory, as that's where I'm putting Bower dependencies
/source/javascripts/lib

# Ignore Sass' cache
/.sass-cache

# Ignore vendored bundle
/vendor
