title: Thoughts on interviewing

I've just started getting involved in interviewing engineer candidates at Google, and I wanted to get my thoughts down while they're fresh in my head and before I've been so influenced by Google's approach to interviews that I can't imagine other approaches.

For starters, let me just list some *possible* problems with the way I'm seeing interviews happen at Google.[^possible-problems]

1. There's too much of a focus on algorithms, and not enough on identifying other types of engineering strengths
2. Candidates are encouraged to go into greater depth than necessary when solving problems
3. A candidate's *speed* in solving problems is given too much weight
4. Problems are too theoretical
5. Problems are unnecessarily difficult

## Too many algorithms

We at Google sure do love algorithms. And I think that makes sense, both in terms of Google's products and Google's culture. Many of the company's products make heavy use of machine learning, distributed computing, and other technologies that are built on advanced algorithms and data structures. And the culture is definitely one that glorifies all things nerdy and theoretical.

So I *do* think algorithms should be a significant part of the interview process here, for *culture fit* alone if nothing else.

However, Google's interview process doesn't just *include* algorithms. It's basically 5 or 6 rounds of multiple algorithm problems in succession *and nothing else*. I know that was my interview experience, and from what I've seen so far on the other side of the fence that seems to be the norm.

I've made this analogy before, but I think it's a good one. Think of basketball players. One trait that is probably loosely correlated with overall basketball ability is free throw percentage: how often a player can make a shot from the free throw line without anyone blocking the basket or interfering. Now imagine that a team hired players exclusively based on their free throw percentages. This team might have an extremely impressive average free throw percentage---probably the best in the world!---but it's pretty obvious that wouldn't mean it had all the best players.

So I think hiring engineers based almost exclusively on their performance on algorithm-heavy interview questions is like hiring basketball players based almost exclusively on their free throw percentage. You will likely get *some* of the best talent---many of the best engineers are probably great at algorithms, just as many of the best basketball players are probably great at free throws---but you will also miss a lot, and you will hire some mediocre people who just happen to be very strong in one area.

## Too much depth

The way most interviews at Google seem to work is this. First, the interviewer states a problem. The candidate then thinks about it for a minute or two, maybe they discuss the problem back and forth a bit, and eventually they settle on some sort of solution. (If a candidate can't come up with anything at all, he is obviously doomed.) Then the interviewer asks the candidate to actually implement the solution, by writing code (some interviewers allow pseudocode) on a whiteboard.

I think it's perfectly reasonable to ask candidates to write some code. Naturally we want to avoid [FizzBuzz](http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/) situations. I don't think doing it on a whiteboard is ideal, but I also don't think it's a huge problem. However, I do think that asking a candidate to write out a *full implementation* of some code *on a whiteboard* is overkill. It's spending precious diving deeply into just one problem, when it would probably be more informative to trade a little depth for breadth and explore other problems.

[^possible-problems]: I emphasize *possible* here because I'm not 100% convinced of the points I'm about to make, nor do I think if they're "right" that it's necessarily a black-and-white situation. These simply indicate the way I'm leaning at the moment.
