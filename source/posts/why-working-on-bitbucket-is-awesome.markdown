I used to work at [ThoughtWorks][1] as a consultant. It was a great gig, and to this day I believe some of the people I worked with there will be among the best teammates of my career. After a couple years there, though, I started to get curious about what it would be like to work at a company where I felt a true sense of ownership in the work I was doing.

I started looking at startups, and before long I found myself at [Cardpool][2]. I was the fourth engineer on the team. The role came with tons of responsibility, and it was honestly pretty thrilling. I remember the first time I had to SSH into a production server and fix a problem. We were out to a team dinner, and my boss noticed on his phone that the website was down. One of the senior engineers took me outside and we worked on a laptop on the sidewalk, piggybacking off some free Starbucks WiFi nearby to fix a production issue. I don't remember what the problem *was*, but I remember the rush of adrenaline. My coworker jumped up and down when the website came back up.

That's part of what's so great--and so scary--about being on a small engineering team at a startup. You're the first and last line of defense for all production issues. On the other hand, Cardpool had well under a million customers when I worked there. No matter how much I liked it, I knew I was only having a modest impact on a relatively small number of people.

I left Cardpool to work at Google, for two reasons. The first was the one I already alluded to: I wanted some experience working at a company making a big impact. Whether you like Google or not, the company's scale and influence on the internet are pretty indisputable. The other reason I left for a bigger company was that my wife was pregnant with our first child, and I wanted to work at a "safe" company with good perks and the stability to ensure I could leave work at work and prioritize family.

It became clear to me at Google that the company's massive scale--taken together, Google's services handle literally *millions* of queries per *second*--was incompatible with the way we worked at Cardpool. Leaving the keys to your infrastructure with software engineers is a reality of life at startups, where the famous Facebook mantra "move fast and break things" really describes the only way to survive; but the bigger they are, the harder they fall, and a large company will never expose itself to that much risk. So my experience at Google was that as an engineer, my interactions with the environments in which my applications ran were always at a distance: changes to config files which were propagated to load-testing environments and then ultimately to servers that were provisioned automatically according to rules managed by an SRE team who could have been based in Helsinki for all I knew.
