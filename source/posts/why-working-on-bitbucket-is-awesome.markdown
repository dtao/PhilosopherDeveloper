1. I remember the first time I had to SSH into a production server and fix a
   problem at Cardpool. It was exciting. But Cardpool had well under a million
   customers (somewhere in the 100s of 1000s, I think). Working at Google, scale
   was much larger but as a "SWE" I was much more removed from the infrastructure itself. Part of the appeal of working on Bitbucket was that the volume is
   huge but as an engineer you're still very close to the infrastructure.
2. We have over a million MAU and something like 20 engineers. That means that
   each engineer is, in a way, supporting ~50k people. It's a huge amount of
   responsibility but a huge reward at the same time.
3. This isn't a site where people share cat photos. We work on a product that
   people actually *use* to get work done; and our company builds an entire
   suite of such products. The opportunities that exist to integrate these
   together in new ways and make it possible for people to get real work done
   more effectively than ever are fairly unique to this team. It's easy to take
   for granted but in reality a very small percentage of software engineers get
   to work on tools that are as widely known, beloved, and legitimately useful
   as Bitbucket.
