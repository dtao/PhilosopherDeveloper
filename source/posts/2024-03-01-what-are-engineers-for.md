I was once out with a group of software engineers who were talking about a challenging project, and one of them said, "It's our job to say what's impossible."

I couldn't stop myself from interrupting. I said wait a minute, that is _not_ what our job is. I think I knew what he was really trying to say, but I saw the moment as an opportunity to challenge what I felt (and still feel) is a backwards view of what engineers are actually for.

Unfortunately for the poor guy, I don't think I did a great job expressing myself at the time. I remember saying something like "The company we work for employs thousands of engineers. Do you think we need _thousands_ of people to say what's impossible?"

I really should have focused more on what the job of engineers actually _is_ (according to Dan, anyway). I'll do that now. To start, let me tell you about my favorite scene from the movie _Apollo 13_, which is about CO<sub>2</sub> filters.

The film stars Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon as the astronauts aboard the space shuttle on NASA's Apollo 13 mission.

This scene doesn't involve any of those characters.

The scene begins with some NASA staff members approaching Lead Flight Director Gene Kranz, played by Ed Harris, to inform him of a CO<sub>2</sub> filter problem on the lunar module. The CO<sub>2</sub> levels are at 8 and rising, they explain. If the levels go above 15 they will lead to "impaired judgment, blackouts, the beginnings of brain asphyxia."

Kranz asks: "What about the scrubbers on the command module?" No luck: "They take square cartridges. The ones on the LEM are round." Then, after a dramatic pause, the flight director delivers the inevitably quotable line: "Well, I suggest you gentlemen invent a way to put a square peg in a round hole... rapidly."

The film then cuts to a team of engineers entering a small room. "Okay people, listen up," says one of the lead engineers, as several boxes full of random items are emptied onto a table. "The people upstairs handed us this one, and we gotta come through. We gotta find a way to make this," he says---holding up a square cartridge---"fit into the hole for this"---holding a round cartridge---"using nothing but that"---gesturing to the pile of items on the table.

The next line we hear, muttered simply by one of the engineers as the camera gives us an overhead view of hands sorting the items on the table, is perfect: "Okay, let's build a filter."

I won't make some grandiose claim about the cosmic significance of engineering or about how this potential within us to solve seemingly impossible problems is part of what makes humanity special and gives meaning to our very existence. (Sorry, did I just accidentally do that?)

I will only say that this scene beautifully encapsulates what I _personally_ love about being an engineer, and what I believe our job _really_ is.

The job of an engineer is, given a set of real-world constraints, to **figure out how to make things work**. The tougher the constraints, the seemingly more impossible the goal, the better.

Need to build a computer [in the shape of a perfect cube with 90 degree angles][1]? You need engineers.

Need to provide [live search results to 40,000 users concurrently every second][2], effectively 10x-ing network traffic to your data centers? You need engineers.

Need to [land a 200-ft, 500-_ton_ rocket][3] on a [small ship in the middle of the ocean][4] after returning from space? You need engineers.

Need to fix dangerous CO<sub>2</sub> levels on a lunar module with only square cartridges and round holes? You need engineers!

**The job of engineers is not to say what's impossible; it's the opposite.** At our best, engineers take what _seems_ impossible and figure out how to get it done.

That's what we're here for.
