title: What are engineers for?

I was once out with a team of software engineers who were talking about a challenging project, and one of them said, "It's our job to say what's impossible."

I couldn't stop myself from interrupting. I said wait a minute, that is _not_ what our job is. I think I knew what he was really trying to say, but I saw the moment as an opportunity to challenge what I felt (and still feel) is a backwards view of what engineers are actually for.

Unfortunately for the poor guy, I don't think I did a great job expressing myself at the time. I remember saying something like "The company we work for employs thousands of engineers. Do you think we need _thousands_ of people to say what's impossible?"

I really should have focused more on what the job of engineers actually _is_ (according to Dan, anyway). I'll do that now. To start, let me tell you about my favorite scene from the movie _Apollo 13_, which is about CO<sub>2</sub> filters.

The scene begins with some NASA staff members approaching Lead Flight Director Gene Kranz, played by Ed Harris, to inform him of a CO<sub>2</sub> filter problem on the lunar module. The CO<sub>2</sub> levels are at 8 and rising, they explain. If the levels go above 15 they will lead to impaired judgment, blackouts, and brain asphyxia.

Kranz asks: "What about the scrubbers on the command module?" No luck: "They take square cartridges. The ones on the LEM are round."

Then, after a dramatic pause, the flight director delivers the inevitably quotable line: "Well, I suggest you gentlemen invent a way to put a square peg in a round hole... rapidly."

The film then cuts to a team of engineers entering a small room. "Okay people, listen up," says one of the lead engineers, as several boxes full of seemingly random items are emptied onto a table. "The people upstairs handed us this one, and we gotta come through. We gotta find a way to make _this_," he says---holding up a square cartridge---"fit into the hole for _this_"---holding a round cartridge---"using nothing but that"---gesturing to the pile of items on the table.

The next line we hear, muttered simply by one of the engineers as the camera gives us an overhead view of hands sorting the items on the table: "Okay, let's build a filter."

I won't make some grandiose claim about the cosmic significance of engineering or about how this potential within us to solve seemingly impossible problems is part of what makes humanity special and gives meaning to our very existence. (Sorry, did I just accidentally do that?)

I will only say that this scene beautifully encapsulates what I _personally_ love about engineering, and what I believe our job _really_ is.

The job of an engineer is, given a goal and a set of constraints, to **figure it out**. Figure out how to make it work, even when the real-world constraints make it seem hard. _Especially_ then. The tougher the constraints, the seemingly more impossible the goal, the better.

Need to build a computer [in the shape of a perfect cube with 90 degree angles][1]? You need engineers.

Need to provide [live search results to 40,000 users concurrently every second][2], effectively 10x-ing network traffic to your data centers? You need engineers.

Need to [land a 200-ft, 500-_ton_ rocket][3] on a [small ship in the middle of the ocean][4] after returning from space? You need engineers.

Need to fix dangerous CO<sub>2</sub> levels on a lunar module with only square cartridges and round holes? You need engineers!

Another way to think about it: if it's easy, if the solution is obvious, then you don't even need engineers.

Imagine the Apollo 13 scene were different: suppose the NASA staffers approached Kranz and told him about the CO<sub>2</sub> issue, and when he asked "What about the scrubbers on the command module?" they all just said, "Oh, right! Those will work. We're so dumb!" No need for engineers.

It's only because the solution was _not_ obvious, due to the constraints---square pegs, round holes---that Kranz needed engineers at all.

To be clear, I'm not saying engineers will always be able to solve any problem no matter the constraints. I have certainly encountered problems I couldn't solve with the constraints I was given. But I _try_ to never say that something is impossible. I might say: "I haven't managed to figure it out yet," or: "The only solution I've been able to find so far would be very expensive."

I love engineering because I love figuring things out. Every engineering project is like a puzzle, with a unique goal and a unique set of constraints---the team, the systems, existing infrastructure, available time, company policies, dependencies on other teams, and the list goes on.

**The job of engineers is not to say what's impossible; it's the opposite.** At our best, engineers take what _seems_ impossible and figure out how to get it done.

That's what we're here for.
