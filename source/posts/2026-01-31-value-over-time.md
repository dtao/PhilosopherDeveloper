# The Wrong Question

- Common question: quality or speed? Presents a dichotomy between 2
  competing forces
- Two bad algorithms: value per change (A student syndrome), and change
  per time (move fast and break things)
- Value per change: also known as perfectionism. Do the best possible
  version. Anything worth doing is worth doing right. Etc.
  - The problem with this is simply that it does not include the crucial
  	variable of time. Diminishing returns are real.
  - Speculation: this comes from what most of us experienced during
  	school. The number of challenges we are given is fixed, and the best
  	possible outcome results from doing all of them as well as possible.
  	The real world is not like this: we are not all given the same
  	assignments. The best outcome for you is often not to deliver A+
  	work on everything someone gives you to do.
- Change per time: speed over everything. Do it as fast as possible,
  then move on to the next thing. Also: quantity over quality.
  - This is the opposite of value per change; it includes the variable
    of time, but leaves out the crucial variable of value. Moving fast
    and doing useless work is just as bad as not moving at all.
  - Speculation: this is a classic case of net-zero learning.

# The Right Question

- Recommend value over time. It is not that value matters more than
  speed, or that speed matters more than value, in any objective sense.
  What we are ultimately striving to do is to use the finite time we
  have to provide the greatest value within that time.
- Remember bivariate optimization in math? It's like this. Say you have
  100 ft of fence and you need to enclose the largest possible area.
  - You could "optimize for length" and make it 48 ft long and only 1 ft
    wide, or you could "optimize for width" and make it 48 ft wide and
    only 1 ft long.
  - Both of these approaches are obviously wrong: we can clearly see
    that it isn't true that "length is more important than width" or
    vice versa. The thing we want to optimize - the area - is a function
    of both of those factors. They need to play together.
- I propose quality vs. speed is a false dichotomy. It is like asking
  about "length vs. width".
- Illustrations of optimizing for quality, optimizing for speed, and
  finally optimizing for value over time
- Why does it sometimes feel like leadership only cares about speed (or
  quality)? Because one or the other can be "more important", not
  objectively, but rather _relative_ to the current state of things.

# Car Analogy

- Analogy: driving a car through open wilderness. If we have a
  destination, we need to know both: (a) are we heading in the right
  directly, and (b) how fast are we moving.
  - It's great to make sure we're heading the right way, but if we're
    only moving 2mph it's going to take us a long time to get there -
    possibly so long that the destination won't even be worth reaching
    by the time we get there.
  - It's also great to move fast, but if we're heading the completely
    wrong direction, that doesn't do us any good either.
- One group get in the car, check their instruments, validate they're
  headed the right way, then drive 10 ft. forward. They stop, check
  their instruments again, validate again, and drive another 10 ft.
  - This group is focusing _too much_ on heading the right direction,
    and not enough on getting there faster. To them, as an advisor, I
    might say, "Stop getting out of the car so much and just GO."
- Another group get in the car, figure out what direction they want to
  go, and then just _floor_ it - racing for hours without stopping.
  - This group is focusing too much on moving fast. They could be
    veering wildly off course, even heading 180 degrees the wrong way.
    If I were advising them I would say, "Whoa, pause, check your
    instruments. Stop and check every now and then."
- Clearly the "right" way to drive the car involves a balance between
  paying attention to where you're going while also moving as fast as
  possible.

# Why Speed Gets All the Love

- As I've written before, it is very common that different people need
  to hear different things - some teams are like the car that keeps
  stopping, others are like the car that's frequently veering off
  course.
- If it seems like I am telling you to "move faster", it doesn't mean
  "speed is more important than quality", it means I believe your
  balance is off and there's a better way to get to the destination.
- A lot of intelligent, hard-working people naturally prioritize quality
  *over* speed because they don't consider the time dimension. Again, I
  blame the wrong lessons learned during school for this mindset, as
  every student in a class is forced to the same schedule (all take a
  quiz or a test on the same day, assignments are due the same day for
  everyone) so that time is fixed and quality is the only variable. The
  real world doesn't work like this.
- The other thing is that I know we all want to put our best foot
  forward, which sometimes means planning to put our work in customers'
  hands when it's mostly "done", i.e. let's say 90% done. Sometimes I
  ask if we can ship something sooner, not necessarily because I want
  the overall project timeline to be shortened, but because I believe
  the end result will be higher-quality if we start getting feedback
  from customers much earlier in the process, giving us more time to
  incorporate that feedback into our work.
- There is no set formula here. You could be Harper Lee and create one
  incredible masterpiece, win the Pulitzer Prize, and have greater
  impact than most of us would have in 10 lifetimes. You could also
  hustle your whole life, build 100 companies, and ultimately fail to
  leave a mark.
- None of that changes the fact that time is always limited - the time
  we work on a project, the time we're together as a team, the time we
  work for a company, the time we're here on this Earth - and in the
  end we want to make the most of it.
