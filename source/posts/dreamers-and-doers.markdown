A lot of people have written about [Sheryl Sandberg's *Lean In*](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-In-Women-Work-Will/dp/0385349947/) since the book was published this year. I haven't actually read the book--and probably never will[^probably-will-not-read]--but today it struck me that the discussion has much in common with many other disparate views on the world, and I wanted to point that out.

The most recent example I can recall of a similar discussion is one my wife and I had with a couple of our friends about a week ago. We were talking about [Peter Thiel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel)--one of the founders of PayPal--specifically about his infamous opinion that more young people should be skipping college, or at least college as we currently know it[^intelligence-squared]. One of our friends vehemently disagreed with Thiel, for the simple reason that statistically speaking college has a very positive impact on future earning potential in our country, especially for those coming from lower income levels. She contrasted this with graduate school, which she did remark was typically a waste of time in economic terms. (She then proceeded to note that I went the grad school and spent the next fifteen minutes laughing at me.)

I would characterize the rest of us in the conversation as being much more sympathetic to Thiel's point of view, even if we didn't exactly agree with him. Ultimately the observation I made was that we seemed to be talking about the issue from two very different points of view. I believe Thiel's argument is *not* that, given any random individual who's contemplating attending college, he or she should decide not to go. Rather, he's criticizing the *system* that has developed in our country where many individuals don't actually benefit from the *educational* aspect of a university education, but simply from receiving a degree after four years and the additional career opportunities afforded by that symbolic piece of paper.

This interpretation 

[^probably-will-not-read]: It isn't that I have any aversion to reading the book. It's just that there are many titles on my to-read list ahead of *Lean In*; and the list is growing, not shrinking.

[^intelligence-squared]: For an excellent debate on this topic, featuring Thiel and several others, I highly recommend [Intelligence Squared: Too many kids go to college](http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/550-too-many-kids-go-to-college-our-first-debate-in-chicago).
