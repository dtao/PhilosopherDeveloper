Hate is a disease. You infect someone else by directing yours at them; voila, now they have it too. It spreads very quickly that way. Also, it grows stronger the more you toss it back and forth. I realize it's almost cliche at this point, but maybe part of the reason we're so polarized as a nation right now--as a world, in fact--is that technology has supplied a vector for hate to spread, and we haven't yet discovered the vaccine.

This is the sort of point that most of us will find ourselves nodding our heads to, but I don't think we appreciate it fully. When I say hate is a disease, I mean it pretty literally. The way it infects and spreads, it might as well be. And like typical physiological diseases, hate does not care who you are: man or woman, Christian or Muslim, red or blue. We are all susceptible.

We often think of hate as this thing that bad people have while good people don't. But anyone can contract it, and most of us are already infected. Just browsing my Facebook feed this morning, I've seen friends call America a "dumpster fire", calling Trump a "piece of garbage", saying they're ashamed and embarrassed for our country, or even for humanity.

I've seen Sanders supporters viciously attacking Clinton, lamenting that Bernie would have won; and I've seen Clinton supporters telling those Sanders supporters--fellow Democrats!--to fuck off. I've seen friendships severed, even *family* relationships torn over this.

I myself carry hate. I really, *really* don't like Donald Trump. On top of all of the things he's said that I find offensive, he strikes me as having no humility, and I have a hard time dealing with that. I've called him arrogant, idiotic, insane, and worse things I'm sure.

This is all hateful language. We don't say these things because they're productive, or even because they're right. We say them because we're all infected and we can't help ourselves.

The more I think about this the more I find myself thinking we need to treat hate as a disease more seriously. We need to understand where it comes from, so we know how to avoid it. Ideally we should know how to treat individuals who are infected. But best of all would be something like a vaccine: a way of making us more resistant to it, so that it doesn't spread.

So where does hate come from? The source that comes to my mind immediately is suffering. Donald Trump's support comes in large part from a segment of the population who feel that their jobs are disappearing, their communities are crumbling, and the establishment has done nothing to help them. These people hate the establishment, and direct their anger at convenient proxies for what they see as the establishment's disregard for them. Their suffering provides fertile ground for hate to grow.

There is also fear. In my case, as well as many of my friends, there is a hatred for Trump and his supporters that stems from fear of what he might do.
