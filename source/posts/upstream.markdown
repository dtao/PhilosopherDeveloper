In the wake of the recent polarizing election, many of us have been telling our friends to resist the urge to hate, to reach out to those we disagree with, to try and understand each other. I completely agree with this, but at the same time I'm skeptical that this message will have a significant impact. Encouraging individuals to fight their feelings and control their behavior will have an effect on maybe 1% of the population if we're lucky, the same way appealing to people's compassion elicits a charitable donation here and there but seldom results in any large-scale change.

You cannot *start* with feelings. Feelings are a downstream result of experiences. Telling people to feel or act a certain way is therefore going against the current. Change their experiences and feelings will follow.

It seems to me that much of the anger surrounding controversial issues at the heart of our political divisions stems from experiences that we might be able to change. In particular I believe a very large proportion of the hatred that people are feeling would go away if we were able to fix just two major problems: unemployment and poverty.

I have trouble telling how much truth there is to this, but the narrative currently taking hold seems to be that Trump won the election in large part due to the resentment of working class Americans who have witnessed the evaporation of blue collar jobs in industries like mining and manufacturing. My liberal friends generally recognize this as a real issue but cannot "forgive" these working class people for the racism and xenophobia that seems to have shown itself in their communities. I am no fan of racism of xenophobia, but I am also not a fan of privileged people condemning underprivileged people for feelings that stem from hardship they can't relate to.

We can debate all day whether this line of thinking excuses hateful feelings. My position is that it's a waste of time to debate such things. If we agree that the hateful feelings arise from suffering, then let's focus on getting rid of that suffering, and the hateful feelings will go away too.

I don't have firsthand experience of what it's like to lose your job, or for jobs to disappear throughout your community. I can *imagine* that if this were to happen to me and my community, I would want to understand why. Over enough time my desire to understand would evolve into a need to find someone to blame. Over enough time this desire to blame someone would evolve into resentment and even hatred towards those groups I'd identified.

So instead of continually shining a light on evidence for xenophobia among a group, I believe it would be more productive to figure out how to reduce unemployment among that group.

Likewise, the Black Lives Matter movement stems from the suffering of a community that has experienced a disproportionate amount of violence from law enforcement. Many on the left attribute this to racism, but I believe it's not so simple. Once again, I find it problematic at best that those of us who have never had to make a split-second life-or-death decision are so willing to cast judgment on police officers who succumb to paranoia at a critical moment.

Where does this paranoia come from? Crime rates are much higher in low-income neighborhoods; that is not controversial. And a disproportionately high percentage of low-income neighborhoods are black. Most of my liberal friends--in fact, I suspect most of America, across the political spectrum--would agree that this is due to systemic inequality that has roots stretching back hundreds of years. Whatever the roots, though, this correlation naturally produces bias.

Even many of my liberal (white) friends, if they are honest, will admit to having some bias themselves. We may wish it weren't true, but we cannot help being slightly more fearful of a black man walking on the street at night than a white man. Can you imagine how much more pronounced this bias might be if you were a police officer responding to calls, dealing with crime in black neighborhoods on a nightly basis?

I am not saying this bias is OK or that it excuses anything. Again, I am saying that if we can identify the cause, we should focus on that. So instead of continually shining a light on evidence for racial bias among police, maybe we'd do more good by figuring out how to fight the poverty that leads to the crime that ultimately produces that bias.

Many evangelicals voted on a single issue this election: abortion. For many of these voters, Trump was an awful choice, but a necessary one given that Clinton would have represented a continuation or even expansion of policies they equate with the legitimization of mass murder. Pro-life voters are motivated by compassion for unborn children who need protection from those who would take their lives out of either fear or selfishness. Pro-choice voters tend to be motivated by compassion for young women, often poor, unmarried, and desperate, for whom the potentially heartbreaking choice to terminate a pregnancy results from the feeling that there is no alternative but to bear a child into a life of misery while suffering even greater misery themselves.

Ultimately, both sides view abortion as undesirable. Aside from the controversial legality question, is there a way we could reduce the number of abortions? Once again I propose we consider the upstream cause. 75% of abortion patients are poor or low-income, and 86% are unmarried. This to me strongly suggests a causal relation, which feels intuitive: poor, single mothers tend to be less educated, less likely to use contraception, and have less access to quality health care.

I am not optimistic that our society will reach a consensus on whether abortion should ever be legal, and if so under what circumstances, or whether the government should fund organizations that provide abortion services, any time soon. Regardless, I *do* think that battling poverty would go a long way, with positive effects that both sides of the issue would celebrate.

I could go on. I don't mean to take away from the debate surrounding any of these issues. I also recognize that I haven't proposed any actual solutions: for that, I need to do more research (I intend to), and seriously think about how *I* want to devote my time towards making a difference. What I have suggested so far is basically a way of thinking, of taking a look at some of these issues dividing us and asking whether it's more productive to debate and cast blame or to find solutions upstream.

More than likely, these solutions, if we can find them, will take time. In the interim people are affected *today*. I know that, and so I realize we can't take this upstream approach to the exclusion of any measures that aim to alleviate the downstream effects that millions of Americans are experiencing right now.

Really, though, what I'm writing about is prioritization: when there are 100 problems that need to be solved, it can be overwhelming to try and solve them all at once. Identifying the ones that should be solved *first* tells us how we should be allocating our time and resources. So while I'd prefer for us to tackle the upstream problems for future generations *and* the downstream problems for the current generation, if we had to pick just one, I would go upstream. The fact that the downstream problems are so controversial, and that debating them evokes so much anger and hatred compared to the upstream ones, only makes the decision that much clearer.
