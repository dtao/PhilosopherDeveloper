1. We've all heard "perfect is the enemy of the good."

2. I realized something recently: I make all kinds of points to people (maybe
   valuable, maybe not) in 1-1 conversations; but the rate at which I share my
   thoughts in written form is _much_ slower. Probably 100x slower.

3. A big part of the reason for that ratio is the amount of scrutiny I apply to
   the things I write vs. the things I say in face-to-face conversations.
   Meanwhile, the value of the information I share is nowhere close to 100x as
   valuable.

4. I suspect the phenomenon of diminishing returns kicks in very quickly for me
   with written communication. Most of the value is captured in the first 10%
   of time invested; the remaining 90% of time invested only improves the final
   result by, say, 10 to 20%. This is what that looks like:

5. Over the course of my life, my hypothesis is that I would have a bigger
   impact by polishing less and delivering more. If you're reading this and
   you're a perfectionist, or even just _kind of_ a perfectionist (which is how
   I would describe myself), this probably resonates with you. (We all already
   know this about ourselves. Part of the curse of perfectionism: we are all
   too aware of our own shortcomings.)

6. Therefore! New rule: not 100% enforced, by as a general policy I will try to
   force myself to fit things into an hour. When I find myself with an hour of
   uninterrupted time (side note: this should really not be as rare as it is --
   something else for me to work on), I'll start writing an idea I have and at
   the end of the hour it's pencils down: I'll publish it, no matter what state
   it's in.
