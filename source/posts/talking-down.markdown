Whenever I see someone talk down to someone else, I think, "What was the point of that?"

Don't get me wrong; I do it too. But I still think it, even when I was the one doing it, usually
shortly after the fact. Why do we do this?

Being talked down to has never caused anyone to think critically about a position. It's never
prompted earnest soul-searching or opened anyone's eyes to their own transgressions. Talking down
to people *just* makes them furious, as well it should, because the only real reason to talk down
to someone is to make yourself feel better.

It's basically stealing: you're taking from someone else and giving to yourself. It's just that
instead of taking someone's money you're doing damage to their self image. Instead of profiting
financially you're getting a momentary emotional high at the other person's expense.

I kind of think talking down to each other is an epidemic in this country. I say this as someone
who enjoys watching The Daily Show, and Samantha Bee, and John Oliver. *Gosh* do these shows like
to make fun of conservatives. I tell myself they're educational--and maybe they are to an extent--
but at what cost?

Meanwhile conservatives have The O'Reilly Factor and Breitbart, which are not really so different.
The left refers to conservatives as ignorant and bigoted. The right refers to liberals as gullible
and out of touch.

When we talk about each other this way, the question of who's "right" is sort of irrelevant. If
someone comes charging at you, you don't think "I should seek to understand why this person is
charging at me"; you automatically defend yourself. That's what humans do when we're attacked. And
yet we laugh at each other--another kind of attack--constantly, and then we wonder why our
country's so divided.

Maybe it's a chicken-or-egg thing. Maybe the non-stop two-way condescension is a result of our
division, not the cause of it. Even so, it certainly doesn't make it any better. I fear it's making
it worse, and the only way we can turn things around is if we stop making fun of each other. But
for that to happen both sides would need to lay down their arms, and I'm not sure who's going to
negotiate that ceasefire.
