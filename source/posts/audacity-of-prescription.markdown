I recently wrote a protip on Coderwall called ["Bootstrap without all the debt"](https://coderwall.com/p/wixovg) and it got a *lot* of views[^lot-of-views], mainly thanks to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6740324). Of course, with the HN reference came a lot of very opinionated readers, among them some who seemed to think I was saying something a lot more controversial than what I *thought* I was saying.

Some pointed out that CSS selectors can get out of hand when you use SASS's `@extend` directive, and that the strategy I promote in the protip breaks Bootstrap's JavaScript features. Others argued that on large projects, you're better off without an extra layer of abstraction between your markup and your UI framework. Still others questioned the inherent value of semantic markup itself, even going so far as to accuse me of "parroting" (ouch) an ideal that died years ago (the so-called ["semantic web"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web)), and asserted that any attempts to decouple yourself from a framework in the first place are misguided.

If I may[^if-i-may], at the risk of sounding defensive[^sounding-defensive], I took a bit of liberty in paraphrasing these remarks in the form of a comic strip[^comic-strip]:

![Sometimes a piece of advice isn't universally applicable, and that's okay](/images/bicycle.png)

[^lot-of-views]: Man, I wish any posts on this *blog* would get 60k+ views!

[^if-i-may]: And *clearly* I may, since this is my blog!

[^sounding-defensive]: Which *clearly* I do, because I am!

[^comic-strip]: To make this cartoon I used a nice little tool called [Make Beliefs Comix](http://www.makebeliefscomix.com/).
