Hate is a disease. You infect someone else by directing yours at them; voila, now they have it too. It spreads very quickly that way. And it grows stronger as it spreads, reinforcing itself in an endless cycle. I realize it's almost cliche at this point, but maybe part of the reason we're so polarized as a nation right now--as a world, in fact--is that technology has supplied a powerful vector for hate to spread, and we haven't yet figured out a way to stop it.

This is the sort of point that most of us will find ourselves nodding our heads to, but I don't think we appreciate it fully. When I say hate is a disease, I mean it pretty literally. The way it infects and spreads, it might as well be. And like typical physiological diseases, hate does not care who you are: man or woman, Christian or Muslim, red or blue. We are all susceptible.

We often think of hate as this thing that bad people feel while good people don't. But anyone can contract it, and most of us are already carriers. Just browsing my Facebook feed this morning, I've seen friends call America a "dumpster fire", calling Trump a "piece of garbage", saying they're ashamed and embarrassed for our country, or even for humanity.

I myself carry hate. I really dislike Donald Trump from what I've seen. On top of all of the things he's said that I find offensive, he strikes me as having no humility, and I have a hard time dealing with that. I've called him arrogant, idiotic, insane, and worse things I'm sure.

This is all hateful language. We don't say these things because they're productive, or even because they're right. We say them because we're all infected and we can't help ourselves.

The more I think about this the more I find myself thinking we need to treat hate as a disease more seriously. We need to understand where it comes from, so we know how to avoid it. Ideally we should know how to treat individuals who are infected. But best of all would be something like a vaccine: a way of making us more resistant to it, so that it doesn't spread.

Is this possible? Imagine if it were: if you could somehow be "immunized" at a young age, so that as you grew older and encountered the things that lead most human beings to feel hatred--mostly suffering and fear--your natural instinct were to seek a deeper understanding, to connect with those you disagreed with, to confront your fears, and to grow. Imagine if *everyone* were immunized in this way.

I admit I may just be fantasizing. But it's an idea that I feel may be worth pursuing.
