There's a lot of serious injustices in the world today. The unfair representation of women and
racial minorities[^racial-minorities] in tech is one example, but there are plenty others. And I
think it's important to try our best to *do* something about these injustices, where we can, or at
the very least to be careful not to reinforce them. And part of that is simply keeping them in mind,
so that we see them when they arise (which is often) and can adjust our behavior accordingly.

What saddens me is when I see fighting among those whose hearts are in the right place.
