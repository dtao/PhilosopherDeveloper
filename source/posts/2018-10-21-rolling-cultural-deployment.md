1.  Software runs in an environment. A deployment is when you update the
    software running in an environment.
2.  A _rolling_ deployment is one where you update portions of the environment
    in sequence, so for a time (until the deployment is over) you have both old
    and new code running at the same time.
3.  Sometimes the new code is incompatible with the old code. For example, a
    field is removed from an API, but some of the old code was referencing that
    field. In a rolling deployment, this causes errors as the two incompatible
    versions of the code coexist for a time.
4.  The "right" way to do a rolling deployment, therefore, is to do so in
    stages. To introduce backwards-incompatible changes (like removing a field
    from an API), you must first deploy a version of the code that doesn't use
    the field anymore. In the next stage you can safely remove the field.
5.  Culture is a bit like software. The traditions, values, and rules that we
    collectively share are akin to a "version" of the software, and our society
    is the "environment" in which it runs.
6.  No two people have exactly the same version since we don't all share
    exactly the same values or traditions. But the values we generally all
    accept do shift over time. Examples: abolition, civil rights, women's
    suffrage.
7.  In this sense culture is experiencing an ongoing rolling deployment, to one
    of the most complex environments imaginable. We're all running different
    versions of the software, and new versions of it are constantly being
    deployed, through art, pop culture, the news media, schools, politicians,
    books, and a million other things.
8.  Sometimes our software is incompatible. Maybe you have a relative who uses
    language that most of society doesn't use anymore, or who doesn't "get" a
    particular social movement. At the same time, maybe you (or I) have some of
    your own outdated software running, and in a year, five years, ten years,
    you'll look back and realize you were wrong. In any case, when the old and
    new software coexist, it causes errors: misunderstanding, disagreement,
    conflict, and sometimes violence.
9.  As with software, the way to prevent these errors is to make changes in
    stages. First you need to deploy a version of the new code that's still
    compatible with the old. In culture we call this "tolerance".
10. Earlier I used the word "right" to describe the method for doing rolling
    deployments. In software, this is the way to do it if you want to avoid
    errors. However, there's a downside: it takes longer. Sometimes the old code
    is so flawed that the value of getting the new code deployed as fast as
    possible outweighs the cost of the errors.
11. I'm not the one to say when a cultural change is sufficiently urgent that
    the stages can be skipped. Just pointing out that rolling out in stages,
    in the context of the deployment of culture, requires forgiveness.
