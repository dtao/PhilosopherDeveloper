When we were teenagers, my brother and I imagined a gnarly moral dilemma: what
if you could make the world a better place, but the price you had to pay was
that _you_ would become the most evil person who ever lived? The rest of
humanity would inevitably band together if necessary to stop you from causing
great harm, and a long era of peace and prosperity would follow. But the people
of the future would loathe you, having no knowledge of the choice you had
made.

The company where I am currently employed (Atlassian), like many tech companies,
is in the midst of significant organizational changes as I write this. A new CTO
joined less than a year ago, as have many senior leaders from other prominent
technology companies like Microsoft and Meta. Only a few months ago the company
announced their first-ever company-wide layoffs. And there have also been quite
a few high-profile departures from senior leaders who had been with the company
for many years.

I was recently chatting with a peer and we were sharing our experiences and
perspectives working through these changes, as fairly senior leaders ourselves.
He said something like "It's clear _something_ has to change, either our culture
or our leadership's culture." I noted that _both_ would surely change; the
question was only how much change to expect from either side. The executives who
had recently joined would inevitably find themselves adapting to the culture of
their new employer. And the rest of the company would likewise adapt to its new
leadership. On this we agreed.

I don't believe that one-directional change is actually possible. You
can't _change a thing_ without changing yourself. In order to have an effect,
you must also allow yourself to be affected.

The picture that always comes to mind for me is that of some ice cubes being
dropped into a bowl of soup that's too hot. The diner's intention is to cool
the soup down. We understand that in order for this to happen, the ice cubes
have to melt.

In life, we often want to either effect or resist change. Sometimes we're the
soup, other times we're the ice cubes.

When we're the soup, we may fear the ice cubes. They seem too extreme.
_"If we all dropped to_ your _temperature, the soup would be freezing!"_ And
perhaps, sometimes, there is reason to be concerned: we see the rate of ice
cubes being dropped into our bowl, and we worry things will go too far. It's
true that sometimes you add a few too many ice cubes and your soup ends up
becoming lukewarm, and then you need to reheat it.

Other times, we see that the soup is too hot, and we want to cool it down. But
we don't want to melt ourselves.

There is a fascinating moral question here, one which I'm not totally sure I
have the answer to. What if you want to [be the change][1], but you're not sure
how much change it will require in _you_? Do you risk melting entirely into the
soup?

We're all comfortable with the idea of heroic sacrifice. But remember that in
this metaphor, _melting_ means _becoming like the thing you wanted to change_.
In stories where this happens, we don't see it as a sacrifice; we see it as a
tragic ending.

I doubt that I would always be brave enough to choose to be the ice cube. I feel
admiration for those who do---if only we knew who they were.
