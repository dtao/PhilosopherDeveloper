## Part 1: The classic tale

- Businessman sees fisherman relaxing, suggests that he catch more fish and
  sell the extra.
- Why? So he can buy more boats and catch more fish.
- Why? So he can become rich and retire.
- Why? So he can just relax and fish when he wants to.
- What does the businessman think the fisherman is doing right now?

## Part 2: The need for respect

- The businessman returns, says the fisherman should still catch more fish.
- Why? Because otherwise, people will believe he never accumulated wealth
  because he couldn't, not because he chose not to.
- If he chose not to, why should it matter whether or not he could? Because
  until he's demonstrated that he could, he can't prove that not pursuing
  wealth was a choice.
- Why should he have to prove it? Because unless people are convinced it was a
  choice, they won't respect him.
- Who will not respect me? Well, people like me, replies the businessman.
- The fisherman looks at the businessman. Why should it matter to me whether I
  have your respect?

## Part 3: The pursuit of self-actualization

- The businessman comes back again, says regardless of what others think, the
  fisherman should catch more fish.
- Why? To understand his own potential. Unless he tries to catch more, he will
  never know how much money he _could_ make.
- Why does it matter how much money he could make? Because without knowing, he
  will always wonder.
- Why would he wonder? Because if he doesn't know this, then he doesn't truly
  know himself.
- The fisherman asks: how many fish are you able to catch on a good day? The
  businessman doesn't know; he isn't a fisherman.
- So I don't know how much money I could make, but you don't know how many
  fish you could catch. Perhaps neither of us truly knows ourselves.

## Part 4: Preparing for a rainy day

- The businessman returns once more, says whether or not he needs to prove
  himself to anyone, the fisherman should still invest in catching more fish.
- Why? Because in case there's ever a shortage, it would be good to have extra
  fish to provide for his family.
- Why would there be a shortage? Perhaps from overfishing.
- Then I would have caused the very problem you are advising me to prepare for.
  Not necessarily: your fellow fishermen may be the ones responsible.
- So I should take all of the fish for myself before my fellow fishermen have a
  chance to do so? Exactly.
- We all care about each other and look out for one another when times get
  tough. What you are suggesting would only cause us to become rivals and
  weaken us all.

## Part 5: Think of the children

- The businessman comes back for a final chat. I have thought of a reason that
  you should really catch more fish.
- What's that? Well, you have children. While you may be satisfied with your
  life as a fisherman, they may want to pursue other dreams. Some of those
  dreams are likely to require more money than you can afford with such modest
  resources.
- That is true. A-ha! At last I have you, says the businessman.
- The fisherman sighs. Just then a boy walks up. Want to play a game with me?
  he asks.
- I'm sorry son, he says. Not right now. I think I had better go work a bit
  more before calling it a day.
- The boy asks his father to stay, but the fisherman explains that he needs to
  go catch more fish to sell in order to make some money.
- The businessman watches as the fisherman walks off toward the water, feeling
  pleased with himself for having finally helped him understand.
