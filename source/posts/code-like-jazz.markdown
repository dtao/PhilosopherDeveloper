There are two types of musician. Actually, that's a gross oversimplification; in fact it's a flat-
out falsehood. But for the sake of this post let's say it's true. The two types I have in mind are
what I'll describe as **classical** musicians and **jazz** musicians.

In broad terms---again, oversimplified or perhaps just inaccurate, but bear with me---when you think
of classical music you tend to think of *composers*. Yes, there are soloists; but orchestral pieces
are *compositions* built from many complementary parts. Each instrument plays a supporting role to
strengthen the beauty of the whole.

Jazz can be like that too, but there is a much greater emphasis on individual performers. And while
plenty of jazz songs have carefully planned, complex arrangements, they also generally provide space
to showcase the skills of the instrumentalists. If you listen to just one player in a jazz ensemble,
what you hear quite often stands on its own. The bass, the piano, the horns---each has a melodic
quality in its own right.

I see a similar division among software developers. For some, the overall system is the interesting
thing; and the code plays a supporting role to that. They're the classical devs. For others the code
itself is very interesting, even beautiful. They're more like the jazz musicians.

Since I'm already on an overgeneralization tear, I'll just keep going. The classical devs are more
likely to use boring languages, like Java, because it works just fine. The code can be completely
mundane but the *system* can be interesting, the same way a cello part might be relatively dull on
its own but contribute something crucial to a truly beautiful symphony.

Classical devs also tend to be more sympathetic to
