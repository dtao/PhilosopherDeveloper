*It's been a while! This is another [60-minute post][1].*

Here's a concept I often find myself mentally coming back to. I frequently want
to use these terms in conversation, but I refrain because I am aware whoever
I'm talking to doesn't have a shared understanding of what I mean by these
terms. So this is me writing it down so that I can link to it in the future.

**Advice** is a suggestion you give someone to be helpful to them as an
individual.

**Guidelines** are instructions you give to everyone in a group, to be helpful
to the group as a whole.

The key difference is in what you're treating as constant. When you give
advice, you aren't trying to change the system; you're just trying to help one
person within the system. You take the system itself for granted. Advice is
unopinionated about whether the system is good or bad.

Guidelines define how a system should be. When you define guidelines, you _are_
trying to change the system. You're writing down how you think things should
work.

Logically, the people with the authority to control a system write guidelines
while those with no authority dispense advice.

Here's an example. Suppose you're visiting a friend in another country and your
luggage gets lost. You ask an airline employee for help, but they say there's
nothing they can do. Your friend knows corruption is rampant, so he suggests
that you offer the employee a bribe. This would be _advice_: your friend
obviously knows that corruption is wrong, but he's not trying to change the
system right now. He's treating the fact that the system is corrupt as a given
and focusing on helping you, his friend.

Now imagine that the airport authority decides to formalize this advice in the
form of guidelines. Suppose that to be helpful to the entire population of
travelers in the airport, they print out signs reading "If your luggage is
lost, please bribe an airline employee to help you" and post them around all
the baggage claims. This would be outrageous. Suddenly the idea of bribery has
been enshrined: it's not just how the system works, it's how the system is
_meant_ to work. There's a big difference.

Here's another example. My wife and I have traveled to many other countries. In
some of the places we've visited, it isn't safe for women to go out alone at
night due to high rates of violent crime against women. When the locals in
these places have advised my wife not to go out after dark without me, that has
been helpful advice. Of course this doesn't mean that women should not be
allowed to go outside at night without their husbands. These individuals are
trying to be helpful: they can't stop the crime themselves, so they treat it as
a given and offer suggestions to avoid it.

One last example. If my friend is interviewing for a new job and she gets as
far as salary negotiations, I will probably tell her to lie about what she's
currently earning. This is because I know that in many cases this will
[anchor][2] what the recruiter or hiring manager will offer her, and I also
know that there's a gender wage gap at many companies, so she'll likely get a
smaller offer than a male candidate would if she _doesn't_ lie. I don't _like_
that there's a wage gap, or that companies try to pay their employees as little
as possible; but when I'm looking to help one person (my friend) within the
system, I will take the system as it is for granted.

Sometimes we mistake advice for guidelines, and vice versa. This can be the
result of a mismatch in perceived authority. As a manager, I might offer advice
to someone on my team that, if I'm not careful, they'll interpret as guidelines
and communicate to their peers as such. I might not see myself as having the
power to change the system, but they might think that I do, hence the
disconnect.

Now flip the salary example around and pretend you're in control of the system:
you're running your own company, so you get to decide how salaries are
determined. Would you say, "We'll ask candidates what they're currently making,
assume they're lying, and negotiate them down to where we think they are (and
incidentally, we will gladly perpetuate any unfair wage gaps that exist with
this approach)"? Hopefully not. That doesn't feel[^feel] like how the system
_should_ work. I'd like to think that if I'm running my own company one day, it
would be more like: "We'll establish a fair salary for every role we need, and
when we hire someone into that role that's what we'll pay them, regardless of
what they were making before."

Of course, if that isn't how every _other_ company does things, I might start
to worry: maybe I'll end up paying junior employees more than I should, or I'll
miss out on top talent because my offers to them aren't high enough. When I
start thinking along these lines, I become doubtful of my ability to define the
system after all; and when I don't believe I can change the system, I don't
bother writing guidelines, I just give advice.

So that's the concept. If this distinction between guidelines and advice makes
sense to you, you'll probably start to notice it quite a lot in the world.
