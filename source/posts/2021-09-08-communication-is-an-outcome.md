title: Communication is an outcome

This is something I've observed countless times in both my personal and
professional life.

Often, I will hear someone say that they sent someone else an email, or a Slack
message, or a text, confident that they communicated important information to
the other person.

It can be the same when a team member says, "I wrote a blog post about
this." Or: "I shared a page with the team." Or: "I gave a demo of this."

The fallacy is a misunderstanding of good communication. **To _communicate_
something means to successfully transfer the information into another person's
brain.** It isn't just the sending, it's confirmation of the receipt.

What if you send a Slack message and the recipient doesn't notice it? What if
you publish a blog post and no one reads it? Then you aren't actually
communicating. You're putting a message in a bottle and hoping someone
discovers it when it washes ashore.

Am I claiming that, when you share information, it is 100% your fault if your
audience doesn't absorb and remember it forever? No. Without a doubt, I have
allowed my mind to wander when I should have been paying attention far too many
times. I have also honestly _forgotten_ things that people have told me. We all
have. To the extent these cases represent communication failures, the fault was
mostly or entirely mine. But they were still communication failures.

What I'm saying is that **communication is an outcome, not an action**.
Communication is not saying things, or writing things, or sharing things. _How_
you communicate something is an implementation detail; what matters is whether
it actually lands, and sticks, in the mind(s) of your audience. Skilled
communicators are those who can reliably transmit information accurately all
the way into other people's heads.
