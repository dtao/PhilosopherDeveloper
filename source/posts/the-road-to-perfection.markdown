The road to perfection is never-ending.

I visualize the path of personal progress---whether as a software engineer, or otherwise---as a perilous one, riddled with illusions. Wherever we stand, we think we're on an island of englightenment and look back at those further back on the path with disdain. "Don't walk along those rickety bridges!" we shout back at them. "They are poorly built! They will collapse underneath you!" Meanwhile we forget that we had to cross those very same bridges to get where we are. And to those ahead of us on their own paths, our island of enlightenment is itself a garbage pile. 

PHP and Visual Basic
--------------------

At Cardpool we used to tease our designer because he preferred PHP to Ruby on Rails. Sometimes he would ask the other engineers how to do something basic in Ruby, one of us would tell him, and he'd sort of roll his eyes and go "Ugh, this would be *so* much easier in PHP." And we'd all have a good laugh (or *I* would anyway, because I'm a jerk) at how *foolish* he sounded for saying such things.

The tech community loves to hate PHP because it's a "bad" language. And it really is. This has been discussed in about a million places; there's [a popular blog post that calls the language "a fractal of bad design"](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/) if you want to read one.

There's also a lot of hate for Visual Basic, a similarly crappy language (not to be confused with VB.NET, a perfectly respectable language[^respectable-language] but with baggage by association with its heritage). VB is really verbose, has maddening error handling, uses 1-based array indexing (*what?!*), and has all kinds of other issues. Again, totally true.

Guess what my first exposure to software development was? Hacking VBA macros in Microsoft Excel and writing little webpages in PHP.

Could it have been otherwise? I don't know; maybe. But I have this hypothesis that if you're going to reach the island of Ruby on Rails, a path through the PHP forest is the best route to take. If you're going to become a world-class application developer, spending some time in the swamp of VB is good for you.

Here's the thing. If you're using a Microsoft Office, you can click "Create a Macro" (or whatever the button is), record a few actions, then open up an editor and see code. It's pretty obvious how you could tweak that and make it do something a little different. So the distance from "I don't know how to code" to "Gee, look at what I just did!" is quite small.

Same with PHP. You follow maybe one online tutorial to set up an Apache server with mod_php, then you open up localhost in your browser and suddenly you see your work on the screen.

The key in both cases is that these "awful" technologies make it very easy to *get started building something*.

Meanwhile, imagine taking a complete neophyte and helping him or her get started with Rails. "Well, to begin with you must understand this concept called MVC. Here are some articles explaining the concepts." This poor soul will be completely lost. The ideas of MVC are completely abstract and intangible. You know what makes them easy to understand? Working in PHP until your site gets too large and complex to manage. Then the idea of separating your code's concerns takes on a visceral appeal. You can immediately see why it's helpful.

It's also much easier to see the appeal of moving forward when the ground is icky where you're standing. In this respect I think the "ickiness" of PHP and Visual Basic is an asset. Unless you're working on some legacy code base[^legacy-code], my impression is that you generally move on from these languages.

[^stupid]: All in good fun, of course. We obviously didn't really think he was stupid, or we wouldn't have hired him.

[^respectable-language]: And for all I know, PHP has cleaned up its act and is perfectly fine in its latest incarnation as well. I don't know because I haven't used it in years.

[^legacy-code]: I don't mean to denigrate the role of those who find themselves in exactly this position. The fact is that there's a whole world of software development I've been largely sheltered from, and that's maintaining legacy systems. I respect and admire those who do it, and I don't envy them.
