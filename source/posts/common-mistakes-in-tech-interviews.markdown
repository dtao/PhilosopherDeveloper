title: Common mistakes in tech interviews

Here's a thing I've had many conversations about but never bothered to write
down anywhere: things most of us do *wrong* when conducting tech interviews. I'm
choosing to write it now because it's come up again recently on my team (I lead
the Bitbucket engineering team in Austin). I'm sure others have written down
similar ideas already, probably more eloquently than I am about to; but I'm an
engineer so if it [wasn't invented here][1] I'm going to invent it again.

Honestly, there are probably more than three common mistakes; but I'm choosing
to focus on three because [them's the rules][2]. Here they are:

1. We often think of the interview as a *filtering* process. I believe we should
   think of it as a *matchmaking* process.
2. We always look for the *same skills* in every candidate. I believe we should
   look for *unique skills* in every candidate.
3. We tend to establish an *asymmetrical dynamic* with candidates. I believe we
   should strive to put ourselves on the *same level* as candidates.

# Filtering versus matchmaking

So first, the filtering mentality. This is our instinct: when there are many
choices available to us, we seek to filter them down so that we can focus on a
manageable set of options to make a decision. Single people do this when seeking
partners: they come up with a list of criteria (smart, funny, good-looking) and
quickly discount would-be partners who don't check all the boxes.

Tech jobs are in high demand, so it's tempting to adopt this filtering approach
in tech interviews as well. Assuming you have a decent recruiting pipeline,
though, by the time you're interviewing someone in person you *probably* don't
need to be so worried about filtering out *bad* candidates anymore. By the
in-person interview a better use of your time is trying to identify *good*
candidates.

What's the difference? Back to the dating analogy. Some people make their list
of criteria too long, or too strict. They turn down potential partners who could
otherwise be a strong match because they didn't go to a prestigious school, or
they aren't athletic, or they have bad taste in music. After a certain point the
filtering process is no longer helpful; the risk of erroneously passing on good
options outweighs the benefits of narrowing the pool.

Remember the point of filtering. It's to reduce the set of options to a
manageable size, not to make a final decision. If you're deciding on a
restaurant to go for dinner, in a city like Austin you have hundreds of options.
Naturally you need to start by filtering: maybe you pick a cuisine first,
followed by something like availability of patio seating or whether the
restaurant is kid-friendly. But once you've narrowed it down to a small handful
of choices, your decision-making process shifts to "Which of these choices do
I like the *best*?"

Tech interviews should be the same way. When you're interviewing someone you
should be *looking* for what that person's *strengths* are, not identifying
their weaknesses. Everyone has weaknesses. Those aren't interesting. There are
a lot more things that I'm *not* good at than things I *am* good at. Filtering
out candidates in the interview for not knowing the answer to one question means
you could be totally missing how they would have knocked a different question
out of the park.

Here's another way of putting it. I think some interviewers start candidates off
with a perfect 10 and *deduct* points as the interview goes on for getting
stumped by questions or failing to complete challenges. I prefer to start off at
0 and give *myself* points for discovering things about the candidate--skills,
knowledge, experience, aptitude--that are impressive. With a strong candidate, I
should be able to get that score pretty high by the end of the interview. If I
was searching the whole time for strengths but end up with a low score, it
doesn't mean for sure the candidate was weak, but at least I didn't waste the
time focusing on areas where the candidate wasn't strong.

# Same skills versus unique skills

This one baffles me. For some reason we all acknowledge that day-to-day, we
seldom need a deep trove of computer science knowledge to do our jobs. Yet we
spend an inordinate amount of time in most interviews asking candidates about
binary trees and algorithmic complexity.

For the record, I do think it's valuable to have some engineers on the team who
are strong in these areas. They aren't always relevant, but sometimes they come
in handy. That said, I certainly don't think *everyone* on the team needs to be
strong in these areas. This is especially true when being strong in these areas
comes at the expense of being weak in other areas.

In my experience, the most effective teams are not teams whose members all have
the same sets of skills. They're teams made up of people with a diverse range of
complementary skills. For example, maybe some team members are meticulous and
detail-oriented while some are much more focused on meeting goals and getting
things done. As a leader, having these kinds of people working together can be
extremely useful. You know who's the best person for each task. Sometimes you
even put these teammates together and the way their skills and instincts balance
each other yields awesome results.

The point is that maybe when you're interviewing someone you should not be
looking for the same thing every time. Maybe it's better to ask yourself, "What
sort of person could we really use on this team right now?" and look for that
person. Today it could be a computer science rock star; tomorrow it could be a
self-taught hacker who's never cracked open a textbook; next week it could be
someone with experience navigating the subtle interactions between product
managers, designers, and the development team, or who's especially good at
focusing on the bigger picture problems the team is trying to solve.

# Testing the candidate versus engaging the candidate

This last one is definitely not specific to tech interviews. It's across all
industries as far as I know. But it's a mistake nonetheless: establishing an
asymmetric dynamic with the candidate, where you as the interviewer position
yourself above the candidate. You know the answer; they don't. You've completed
the challenge a dozen times; they've never seen it before.

This dynamic is harmful for multiple reasons. The biggest is that it makes many
candidates uncomfortable (as well it should), which hinders them from
performing at their best, which will thwart your efforts to rack up a high
score. It is also harmful because it doesn't give you a realistic picture of
what working with this person will actually be like. If they join your team,
you aren't going to be presenting them with challenges you know how to solve.
You'll be collaborating with them on challenges that are new to you both.

For that matter, the asymmetric dynamic does not give the *candidate* a
realistic picture of *you*, either. Which is particularly bad in light of my
last point, which is that this dynamic does not even align with the reality of
the situation. You are actually not in a position of power over the candidate.
Yes, it's true that they can't get the job if you don't offer it to them; but
it's also true that you can't get the candidate to join your team if they don't
want the job.

This brings us back to my first point, that in-person interviews are not a
filtering process; they're a matchmaking process. The candidate is trying to
get a glimpse of what's so great about working at your company. You're trying
to figure out what's so great about the candidate. The most effective way to
ensure a great match is for both sides to be seeking to answer those questions.
