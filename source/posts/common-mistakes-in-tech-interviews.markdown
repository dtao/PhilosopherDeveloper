- common mistakes in the interviewing process:
  - viewing the interview as a *filter*, "deducting" points for weaknesses
    rather than "granting" points for demonstrable strengths
  - looking for the same skills in every candidate (the best teams are made of
    players with complementary skills)
  - establishing an asymmetrical dynamic with the candidate
