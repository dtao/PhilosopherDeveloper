title: How we do tech interviews wrong

Here's a thing I've had many conversations about but never bothered to write
down anywhere: things most of us do *wrong* when conducting tech interviews. I'm
sure others have written down similar ideas already, probably more eloquently
than I am about to. But I'm an engineer so if it [wasn't invented here][1] I'm
going to invent it again.

There are probably more than three common mistakes, of course; but I'm choosing
to focus on three because [them's the rules][2]. Here they are:

1. We often focus on candidates' **weaknesses** without meaning to, by giving
   them challenges and noting when they fail. I believe we should focus on
   identifying their **strengths**.
2. We generally look for the **same skills** in every candidate. I believe we
   should look for **unique skills** in every candidate.
3. We tend to view candidates as **applicants**. I believe we should view them
   as **potential teammates**.

# Strengths, not weaknesses

Spotting weaknesses makes sense, purely for practical reasons, at the top of
a filter. When supply greatly outweighs demand, as is often the case with tech
jobs,

Eventually, though, you need to stop eliminating options and actually start
thinking about which restaurants sound *really good* to you. Similarly, assuming
you have a decent recruiting pipeline, by the time you're interviewing someone
in person you probably don't need to be so worried about filtering out *bad*
candidates. By the in-person interview a better use of your time is
trying to identify *great* candidates.

I think of it a bit like exploring a cave with hidden treasure. The goal is to
explore as much of the cave as possible, to find all the treasure you can. When
a candidate doesn't know something, that's a dead end: waste no time in turning
around and exploring a different part of the cave. If you come out of the cave
saying, "We spent a lot of time hanging out at dead ends," you've wasted your
time. There could have been all kinds of treasure that you missed.

# Same skills versus unique skills

For some reason we all acknowledge that day-to-day, we seldom need a deep trove
of computer science knowledge to do our jobs. Yet we spend an inordinate amount
of time in most interviews asking candidates to balance binary trees or express
the complexity of algorithms in big-O notation. I think the reason we do this is
that we have an implicit assumption that the most valuable people have these
skills.

For the record, I do think it's valuable to have some engineers on the team who
are strong in these areas. They aren't always relevant, but sometimes they come
in handy. That said, not *everyone* on the team needs to have strong C.S. chops.
This is especially true when there are deficiencies on the team in other areas,
such as expertise in key technologies, discipline in testing, or leadership or
mentoring skills.

In my experience, the most effective teams are not teams whose members all have
the same skills. They're teams made up of people with a diverse range of
*complementary* skills. On the Bitbucket team, we've got deep expertise in
Git, Mercurial, Django, Postgres, AWS, Docker; the list goes on. But this
expertise is spread *across* the team; there isn't any one person on the team
who's deeply knowledgeable in all of these areas.

The point is that maybe when you're interviewing someone you should not be
looking for the same thing every time. Maybe it's better to ask yourself, "What
sort of person could we really use on this team right now?" Today it could be a
computer science wizard; tomorrow it could be a self-taught hacker who's never
cracked open a textbook but loves to tinker. Next week it could be someone who
doesn't necessarily write the most elegant code, but who is particularly good at
stepping back and looking at the bigger picture problems the team is trying to
solve.

# Asymmetrical dynamic versus treating candidates as equals

This last one is definitely not specific to tech interviews. It's across all
industries as far as I know. But it's a mistake nonetheless: establishing an
asymmetrical dynamic with the candidate, where you as the interviewer position
yourself above the candidate. You know the answer; they don't. You've completed
the challenge a dozen times; they've never seen it before.

This dynamic is harmful for multiple reasons. The biggest is that it makes many
candidates uncomfortable (as well it should), which hinders them from performing
at their best, which just gets in the way of your efforts to find their
strengths. It is also harmful because it doesn't give you a realistic picture of
what working with this person will actually be like. If they join your team, you
aren't going to be presenting them with challenges you know how to solve. You'll
be collaborating with them on challenges that are new to you both.

For that matter, the asymmetrical dynamic does not give the *candidate* a
realistic picture of *you*, either. Which is particularly bad in light of my
last point, which is that this dynamic does not even align with the reality of
the situation. You are actually not necessarily in a position of power over the
candidate. Yes, it's true that they can't get the job if you don't offer it to
them; but it's also true that you can't get the candidate to join your team if
they don't want the job.

This brings us back to my first point, that in-person interviews are not a
filtering process but a matchmaking process. The candidate is trying to get a
glimpse of what's so great about working at your company. You're trying to
figure out what's so great about them. The most effective way to ensure a great
match is for both sides to be seeking to answer those questions.
