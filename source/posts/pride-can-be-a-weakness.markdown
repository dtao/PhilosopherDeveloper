title: Pride can be a weakness

I remember one day in college when a friend came into the commons area of the
dorm where I lived and asked me and some other friends if his purple velour
shirt made him seem less masculine. A couple of guys gave him a hard time,
making fun of him for wearing such a shirt. I don't think they actually cared
about his shirt; it was more the asking, and the insecurity that suggested, that
they were teasing him about.

We often think of *pride* as a good thing, and it certainly has its benefits.
The notion of taking pride in one's work surely leads many people to do better
work than they would if they didn't care. But my mother always said, "Pride
cometh before a fall." Even as we celebrate pride, in the back of our minds we
know that it can be a weakness too.

To clarify: by "pride" I am referring to the psychological need to be
recognized. I believe it is an overloaded term, so I know that when we speak of
pride that isn't necessarily what we're always talking about. But it is
certainly what was on display when my college friend gave away his desire to be
seen as masculine. More generally it is the driving force behind many behaviors
that I feel are ultimately self-defeating.

In negotiating terms, pride presents a huge opportunity to a shrewd adversary.
In a negotiation, perfectly rational actors seek to make some form of exchange
where each side gets something they want. In an adversarial scenario, each side
aims to *get* more than they *give*, potentially by misleading the other side
or by leveraging some bargaining power. If one side is overly *proud*, it may
be possible to offer them something of little or no value, which strokes their
ego, in exchange for something of actual value.

Hypothetical example: suppose the kings of two warring kingdoms meet to
negotiate a truce. There is some disputed territory that both sides want, but
one is extremely proud and the other is simply cunning. The cunning king might
propose, "My armies will lay down their arms and surrender, declaring your side
to have won the war. In exchange we get the disputed territory, but you get to
declare victory."

This is an unlikely scenario--the proud king would have to be *really* dumb (or
*really* weak) to agree to such a deal--but it illustrates the point. In war
negotiations, declaring "victory" on its own means nothing. It may ostensibly
send a signal of strength, but in fact it is little more than peacock feathers.

My point is to be very skeptical of those who spend a great deal of their time
and energy towards being *perceived* as strong. Real strength and the
declaration of strength are not the same thing. More often, they are opposites.
