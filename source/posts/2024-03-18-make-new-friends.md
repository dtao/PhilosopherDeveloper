- Been at Atlassian almost 10 years
- How I got here
    - Was taking the shuttle to Mountain View for ~3 hrs/day at Google
    - Daughter was just born - wasn't seeing her enough
    - Couldn't afford a house in San Francisco, decided to look for
      opportunities in Austin
    - Friend Justen mentioned that Atlassian was opening an office, maybe I
      could look for a role
- Bitbucket
    - Whenever recruiters contacted me I would say "something in dev tools"
    - Something I imagined: biggest product I could work on and fully understand
      how it works (mostly true)
    - Plus, I'm from Philly - scrappy underdog!
- Memories
    - Building out the Austin team was a joy - first time I ever built a team
      "from scratch", an experience not every leader gets to have (it's fun and
      scary at the same time!)
    - Back then Austin was the "HipChat office" - something like 100 engineers
      in a single year (can't believe that didn't work - link to Mythical Man
      Month), we were that one little engineering team in the corner
    - Team members still around: Michael Frauenholtz, TJ Kells, Kavi Laud, Anna
      Li-Fatou, Ellie Sherwood... and Peter, Caitlin, and Keith are around
      somewhere!
    - Fond memories of team members nearby asking, "Is everything OK over
      there?" probably from hearing me tell TJ to "shut up" for the 10th time
- Compass
    - Time leading the Compass team was short but sweet - believe in the product
      (even found an old blog post of mine pitching a vision for Bitbucket
      where we would be "GitHub for DevOps" focusing on supporting more
      operational use cases)
    - Launching a new product within Atlassian is an interesting assignment -
      some great examples (JPD, Atlas) but part of the challenge is knowing
      which rules to break and when
    - Excellent team, cheering them on
- Open Toolchain
    - The DevOps in "Agile & DevOps"
    - Consistently impressed by the teams in Australia who were always
      delivering despite (or perhaps because of?) my distance
    - Only wish I had more F2F time with everyone as it was always a blast to
      meet up with the engineering teams in person
    - Thank you to Matt Watson for all the beer, and Terry for ordering
      excessive amounts of food including my first and only experience eating an
      Aussie burger with beetroot and pineapple (good luck finding this on a
      menu in the U.S.!)
- Looking back
    - Proud of what all of these teams have managed to accomplish - Escape the
      Data Center (Register article), Compass going GA, MQ "leader" in DevOps
      Platforms incl. Security in Jira (VentureBeat - "groundbreaking") and
      Figma (link to blog post)
    - There's more I wish I could have done - based on feedback one thing I
      would do differently if given another chance is take more ownership of
      influencing product strategy
    - The future is up for grabs - most of us don't feel we can afford to think
      ahead 3, 5, or 10+ years most of the time - but taking the time to
      actually think about it and form a POV is worth it
- Confluence
    - This is really exciting to me - Atlassian's no. 2 product but unique in
      that it's something you get for ALL of your employees
    - Unique within Atlassian for this reason - improvements we make will
      improve QoL for everyone in the company
    - Also just really like the product - have said for a long time, "Whenever
      I move on from Atlassian, I will quickly become known as the new guy who's
      obsessed with writing pages"
    - Got a taste of this when I starting leading eng for Compass, but joining
      Confluence will involve meeting _so_ many new people, it feels like
      joining a new company!
- The Bobblehead
    - I had been wanting to "get out" before this
    - One day my wife challenged me on this weird goal I had
    - What I was making it mean
- Life is full of choices and we often think in terms of "right" and "wrong"
  choices - but every choice contributes to a unique path
    - My children are a constant reminder of this - any regret I have, if it
      went differently I wouldn't have them (butterfly effect)
    - A career of changing companies every 2-3 years would be one path, but
      another is to stay somewhere for 10+ years
    - I don't know what the future holds but my goal is to always remain curious
      and open to what lies ahead
