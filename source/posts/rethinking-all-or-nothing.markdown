Here's a completely generic statement, without any context.

> I want all or nothing.

Taken at the surface, does this sound reasonable? Probably not. Most of us would agree, I think, that being reasonable involves making compromises, and not just always doing whatever's in our own best interests. It's what holds society together.

That said, in the business world I think we're accustomed to shrugging this principle aside. I once worked at a company (I won't name it, but it wouldn't be hard to deduce) where the company's leadership was borderline *obsessed* with defeating the competition. Curiously, this was in a space where the estimated market was eleven figures---i.e., tens of billions---and none of the major players had even come close to saturating it. Why, then, would competition be a focus?

In a similar vein, I think most humans value *consistency* in way that embraces the all-or-nothing attitude. Take company culture as an example. A former teammate of mine once advocated for a company culture *document*: a well-defined set of statements that embody the values of the company. But why? Presumably because we should all be consistent in how we relate to the company.

Consistency on software teams
-----------------------------

In software, in particular, I see this everywhere. We say things like "What's your technology stack?" on the assumption that there's generally just one, even if a company has multiple products. Another one is "We do extreme programming"--again with the understanding that there is a single methodology we use, and we can name it.

But any software professional who's honest with him- or herself will concede that any approach has its pros and cons.

As a concrete example, consider pair programming. As divisive as it seems to be in some circles, I've experienced firsthand that it can be quite valuable. Pairing often leads to better quality, as every line of code is considered by at least two pairs of eyes---at the time it's written---reducing the incidence of bugs and promoting discussion over high-level design decisions. It's also a (not-surprisingly) powerful mechanism for organic knowledge sharing. When developers work in pairs, there are always at least two people who are familiar with any given piece of code. This is on top of the fact that pairs can keep one another focused, leading to greater productivity.

That said, there are times when pairing can get in the way, too. Sometimes working alone for a stretch of time can be much more conducive to individual creativity. Many of us do our best work when given time to play around with a code idea, experiment, and follow our intuitions down a path that may be wasteful or may lead to something genius. Working individually can also instill a greater sense of ownership in a developer's work. Admittedly, that can be a double-edged sword---pride is a dangerous thing---but in moderation giving people ownership over their work can be great for morale.

So why do so many teams insist on either doing one or the other? Why not do both? Suppose you're on a team of 8 developers; maybe 3 days a week you could work in pairs, and the other 2 everyone works individually.

Consistency in internal tools
