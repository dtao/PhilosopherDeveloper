You've probably heard this one before:

> Never end a sentence with a preposition.

If you are (or ever have been) serious about grammar, you probably know that the common "rule" above is not really a *rule* at all. It's just a guideline meant to protect grade school English students from saying things like, "Where's your locker at?" It's similar in that sense to *I before E, except after C*, which covers the majority of English words with those letters but fails for terms like *foreign* and *zeitgeist*; or how many of us were corrected as children to say *You and I* (which isn't always right) instead of *me and you* (which sometimes is).

The basic characteristic of rules like these is that if you were to follow them *all* the time, you'd be right *most* of the time; i.e., you'd be better off than if you didn't follow any rules at all.

## Recovering from grammar snobbery

My opinions about grammar[^opinions-about-grammar] have relaxed drastically over the past... oh, ten years of my life. I used to care a lot about the "rules" of English---as defined and accepted within the privileged socioeconomic group I'm a part of, naturally---and would look down on those who didn't understand those rules. Mistaking *there* for *their*, *your* for *you're*, *it's* for *its*: these were all flags to me, and I when I saw such "mistakes" I would scoff and take pleasure in my superior grasp of the language.

There are two important points I want to make now, though, that highlight why I've come to feel so differently.

1. It's delusional to feel superior to someone for not knowing something *they don't care about*.[^singular-they] Imagine you challenge your friend to a game of one-on-one basketball, he says he's not in the mood, and then you proceed to start shooting hoops and gloating over how badly you're beating him while he's walking away, completely uninterested. That, to me, is grammar snobbery.
2. More importantly, the *rules* of grammar are **artificial rules**. Artificial rules (for things that don't involve human safety or welfare[^rules-involving-welfare]) are not something to be taken too seriously. They're certainly not something that I believe should ever justify a sense of elitism.

But let me take a moment to explain that second point a little more.

## Real rules and artificial rules

When you set goals for yourself, there are always constraints. However, some constraints are *real* and some are not. Real constraints include the nature of the physical world. If you want to travel to China, you can't simply click your heels together and magically appear there. You are constrained by how quickly you, or any transportation vehicle, can actually move through space.

On the other hand there are artifical constraints, such as having to take vacation days from work, not wanting to miss a friend's party---things like that. These are constraints which you *could* break, if you wanted to. But you put them there for yourself, in this case to align your goals with your life's priorities.

Artificial rules often exist for a reason. Sometimes reality can be pretty chaotic; artificial rules bring order and make our lives safer. The laws we obey in society are a perfect example. There's no actual *physical* law preventing you from, say, stealing someone's laptop at a coffee shop. If that were your only goal in life, you could go right ahead and do that. Fortunately (for your victim in this scenario), we have laws that impose harsh consequences for theft of someone else's property.

There are also *layers* of artificial rules. We might say that, when it comes to human behavior, our cultural sense of morality forms the first layer on top of the "real" rules of what's physically possible. On top of that are our social laws. Somewhere above those would be rules of etiquette: how one "ought" to behave out of politeness, even if it isn't enforced by any legal system.

The higher you go with these layers, the more restrictive the rules become. The defining characteristic of real rules (the bottom layer) is that it's *impossible* to break them. But they are also very broad. By the time you get all the way up to rules of etiquette, however---assuming you *follow* all these rules---your behavior is quite restricted. Generally speaking, I would also say that the higher up you go, the less important the rules become. Most of us would much prefer for someone to be rude (to break the rules of etiquette) than to be evil (to break the rules of morality).

## The rules of language

With language, the end goal is to **communicate**. Back when we were still cavemen, I imagine that over time certain sounds evolved to have meaning, like: *over there*, and *woolly mammoth*. Individuals who learned to make and understand these sounds reached a major milestone for our species. Some time later, somebody invented written language. This was another huge leap forward.

At some point, languages became sophisticated enough that their structure could be formalized. We had types of speech, verb tenses, countable and uncountable nouns, the works. If somebody said "Where you going?" we could see that he made a mistake conjugating *to go* and *Ha ha, doesn't he sound funny?* But wait a minute. Is there *any ambiguity whatsoever* in what he said? He didn't follow our *artificial* rules of grammar, no. He still accomplished the goal---to communicate---quite handily.

To be clear: I'm not saying there are *no* real (i.e., non-artificial) rules of grammar. For the purpose of communicating clearly and unambiguously, there are indeed some rules. For example if what I mean to ask is *Where are you currently going?* but I say, "Where you went?" then I am not communicating clearly, as my question seems to be asking about the past. Or if I mean to express *I love you* but I say, "Purple monkey dishwasher"---obviously I've taken a wrong turn somewhere.

So real rules of language exist, but the rules many of us embrace as "grammar" are more restrictive than these real rules. And when you introduce grade school mantras like those I wrote about in the beginning, you get into an area that's even more restrictive than the rules of grammar.

## Bubble or prison?

Let's revisit that first rule I brought up, of never ending a sentence with a preposition. The purpose of such a rule, as I said, is to *protect* speakers from a certain kind of mistake[^certain-kind-of-mistake]. Rules like this, which are overly restrictive, can form a sort of secure bubble. Stick to the rules, stay inside the bubble, and you're sheltered from a large variety of mistakes.

Such a protective barrier can easily become a prison. What if you want to venture outside, to explore the possibilities explicitly disallowed within the bubble? Maybe not all of them are *bad*.

Picture growing up in an urban environment. Perhaps there are "bad" neighborhoods in the city. Your parents tell you never to visit those neighborhoods, for your own safety. Their goal is to protect you from potential harm.

Of course, not everyone who lives in one of those bad neighborhoods is dangerous. Some of them---in fact *most* of them, almost certainly---are good people. So while your parents are seeking to protect you, they are also cutting you off from meeting many people and having many kinds of experiences that could be quite positive.

## Accept artificial rules for what they are

Have I veered off topic a bit here? Probably.

Let me get back to the point and call it a day. Too often we become too attached to artificial rules. Grammar snobbery is one example of this. Personally I believe that dogmatic attitudes about software development are another. When we cling to these rules so fiercely, what often happens is we start to conflate them with *real* rules; we lose our ability to distinguish the two. So when someone makes a grammar "mistake", we think they're dumb; when someone violates my Beloved Software Principle, I perceive flaws in his work.

When we internalize artificial rules *too* strongly, they cloud our judgment. We lose touch with reality. Be honest: have you ever not taken someone's idea seriously because of their poor spelling or grammar? That's a problem.

Let's accept artificial rules for what they are. Often helpful. But not real.

[^opinions-about-grammar]: To be honest, I'm a little embarrassed to even admit this now. That is, I'm embarrassed to admit that I *ever* had strong opinions about grammar.

[^singular-they]: And if you're a strict grammarian, there's a chance you just spotted a "mistake" in that sentence: that I used the word *they* for the pronoun *someone*. If you have strong feelings on this issue, I suggest you Google "singular they" to get a quick sample of the historical use of the word, the many opinions out there today, and the controversy surrounding the prescriptive rules of most modern style guidelines.

[^rules-involving-welfare]: What I'm acknowledging here is that social laws are also "artificial" rules in the sense that they aren't enforced by the laws of nature; and yet I fully support it being illegal to kill or hurt other people. So I don't actually mean to say anything quite as broad as "No artificial rules should be taken seriously." I'm sure there are other exceptions any reasonable person would make as well; let this concession serve as a symbolic placeholder for those.

[^certain-kind-of-mistake]: Well, really, it's to protect them from saying something that would sound (to a certain ear) uneducated and ignorant. But if I actually said, "Where's your locker at?" you would understand me perfectly; so again, it would only *be* a mistake according to artificial rules.
