- style and guidelines
  - pete's style ( foo )
  - js without `this`
  - way i learned javascript (closures everywhere)

- your feelings about language
  - for some, inconsistencies are frustrating
  - prefer conventions to avoid language quirks

- adding rules to improve consistency
  - fine when goal is to utilize as tool
  - some aim to progress further, pursue as art

- for me: concerned when rules are added and enforced despite supposed language mastery
  - example: `readonly` in c#
  - example: no trailing conditionals (or `unless`) in ruby
  - example: never use `with` in javascript

- english is very inconsistent and confusing
  - esperanto created to be unambiguous
  - but depth and complexity contribute to richness of english literature

- example guideline: "never end sentence w/ preposition"
  - useful to avoid mistakes ("where's the bathroom at?")
  - not actually something a serious author would pay attention to

- javascript without `this` is sensible, and perhaps good advice
  - but in general, if your ambition is mastery of language, no need to be so strict
