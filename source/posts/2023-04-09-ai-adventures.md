Back in early 2018 I decided to start learning about cryptocurrency. I created
a website, called "Adventures in Cryptocurrency" (no longer live), to [document
my experience][1] learning about the subject. It didn't last very long: by the
end of January I was [already becoming skeptical][2] at the ostensible
aspirations of the crypto community to offer a decentralized alternative to
traditional banking.

That was five years ago. As I write this, we are in the middle of another
potentially transformative technological wave, as artificial intelligence
dominates the media and seemingly a decent amount of public conversation (it has
come up in real-world conversations for me with a wide variety of people, not
just tech workers). Unlike cryptocurrency, though:

1. I am _much_ more interested in artificial intelligence to begin with: I don't
   have to push myself to learn about AI.
2. In a similar vein, the average person has a strong intuition about how AI is
   likely to have a tremendous impact on the economy and society at large. (In
   contrast, my sense is that the majority of people were always scratching
   their heads over cryptocurrency.)
3. The discourse around AI today feels more grounded and less hype-driven to me
   than it ever was for crypto. Even those who are _most_ bullish on the
   potential for AI to make the world a vastly better place still [recognize
   major risks][3] and worry about catastrophic outcomes.

So I'm starting over again, this time documenting my experience learning about
artificial intelligence.

I haven't yet decided on many of the details of this project. How often will I
write, where will I distribute the content (other than directly via the
website), how will I prioritize my time (mostly reading articles and papers?
taking courses? building things?), will I explore other media besides writing,
etc. are all up in the air as of right now.

What I'm sharing today is simply that I'm doing this, and it's what I expect to
be focused on for a while.

If you're already following The Philosopher Developer and wondering whether this
blog will remain active: at the moment, I do intend to continue publishing here.
Certainly whenever I write about something _not_ related to AI, it will be here.
As for my AI-related content, my current plan is to write _frequently_ on
potentially narrow topics at [aiadventures.net][4] (e.g. summarizing a paper I
read or a podcast interview I listened to) and probably to publish less frequent
updates here, synthesizing the many thoughts I've had and things I've learned
maybe every 2 weeks or so.

Time will tell whether this ends up like the crypto thing or it's the start of
a much longer chapter.
