- Concept of backlog: prioritized list of work
  - Without priority determined up front, tendency to treat whatever's going on right now as top priority
  - Making the decision up front frees up intellectual resources to focus on getting work done

- America needs this, but how do we prioritize?

- Cloud service w/ millions of users (like Bitbucket): top priority must always be stability
  - Instability leads to intermittent failures, which lead to bug reports, complaints, etc.
  - Putting out fires fails to address fundamental issues (why do fires keep happening?)
  - Analogy: sinking ship, always patching leaks vs. ensuring the ship is on course

- When ship is not sinking, prioritization requires some measurable metric (alternative is gut feeling)
  - Keeping Americans safe (minimizing lives lost)?
    - Healthcare probably more urgent than, say, gun control
  - Keeping America peaceful (minimizing violence)?
    - Mass shootings vs. gang violence
  - Providing equal economic opportunity?
  - Maximizing GDP?

- Top priority (in my eyes) should be addressing poverty and education
  - Many of the other divisive issues we face stem from poverty and lack of opportunity
  - If we could all agree to focus on poverty and education, much controversy could (?) be alleviated

- Income inequality
- Gun control
- Incarceration rates
- Police brutality
- Abortion

- Some things admittedly possibly totally separate
  - Marriage equality
    - But education is correlated w/ pro-marriage equality beliefs, so... maybe controversy would go away?
  - Legalization of marijuana
    - But enforcement is maybe disproportionately targeted at the poor
  - Healthcare
    - But wealthier, more educated population generally has it
  - Immigration

- Imagine an America without poverty! Predictions:
  - Significantly reduced gun violence
  - Ditto incarceration rates
  - Ditto abortion rates
  - Ditto police brutality

- Some stuff would obviously still remain, e.g. immigration
  - That would be next on the backlog
  - Also, realistically, obviously the government can do more than 1 thing at a time
  - Problem is currently since we don't all agree on single priority, we're always drawn to fires
