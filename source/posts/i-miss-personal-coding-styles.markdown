- memories!
  - emb
    - pete's style: func( arg )
    - scott's giveaway: 'slime'
  - cardpool
    - robby's quirky hash indentation
    - kevin's love of lambdas

- pete's article on `this` in javascript (brief mention)
  - sensible approach
  - definitely doable (like that pete's tone is more "this is how it can be done" than "you should always do this")
  - HOWEVER, i generally disagree with "never use language feature X" positions

- style guidelines are prevalant things at software companies
  - cardpool, google
  - i hate them

- supposedly about "quality"
  - consistent w/ "engineering" mindset (there is a right way)
  - really (if you ask me) more about protecting devs, being risk-averse

- "cognitive load"
  - no trailing conditionals
  - no "unless"
  - line length limits

- downsides
  - less sense of personal pride - now i see code that's HIDEOUS but conforms to guidelines
  - no cognitive load sort of like protecting children from all germs (immune system suffers)
  - result is lower overall team proficiency, fewer opportunities to re-examine own preferences

[this is maybe not interesting]

- personally
  - flip-flopped on styles plenty of times
  - in c#, eventually started putting brace on new line
  - in ruby, gradually become much more liberal w/ line breaks
  - in javascript, switched from double quotes to single quotes

- readability at google
  - you have readability if you've really internalized the guidelines and always write code that way
  - i think it should be complete opposite:
    - style guidelines are enforced for people WITHOUT readability
    - getting readability means, "I've graduated from the style guide --- i can use my judgment"

- fundamentally this is a cultural thing
  - in some cultures (e.g. google) most people will disagree, prefer to settle on a consistent aproach
  - attitude on "code is art" will influence your preference
  - i think it's on the boundary between art and science, hence my opinion
