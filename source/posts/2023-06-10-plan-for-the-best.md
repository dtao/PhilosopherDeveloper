One Friday night recently, some friends of mine dropped off their daughter for
an evening play date with three other girls. Their daughter hadn't met two of
the other girls, so they hoped she would get along with them but figured most
likely she would still want to come home before bedtime. When they returned
later that evening, the girls had become fast friends and were already making
plans for what they would do the next morning. But since the parents had
assumed their daughter would want to go home, they hadn't brought a change of
clothes, her toothbrush, or anything she would need for a sleepover; so they
found themselves driving home with a deeply disappointed and frustrated child.

This story reminds me of something I have seen many times in the workplace. The
members of a product team will chat often about an idea: a vision, a strategy,
or just a cool feature they'd like to build. These discussions happen in bits
and pieces over Slack, during meetings on Zoom, in social gatherings---but
never "on paper". No one ever takes the time to really put the idea into
writing or flesh out all the details, because _"We'll never get time to work on
that."_ And then one day, some SVP or other senior leader comes along and
asks, "Have we ever thought about..." and the team has nothing to show. They
assumed they would never get the time of day from any senior leadership, and
they were unprepared when the moment came.

We've all heard the expression: _Hope for the best, plan for the worst._ It
sounds so sensible. And of course, it comes from a sensible place. We should
not simply hope that good things will happen and assume all of our dreams will
come true. Bad things _do_ happen, challenges _do_ arise; and if we don't invest
any effort in preparing for them, they can knock us down.

Here's another expression, from President Dwight D. Eisenhower:

> Plans are nothing; planning is everything.

The _existence_ of a plan is one thing. But it is really the _act_ of planning
that forces you to think through the details of what might happen and equips you
to handle different scenarios. This simple act makes a huge difference in
determining whether we are prepared to respond appropriately to different
situations, to take advantage of new information and choose promising new paths
when they emerge from the fog.

One of the most common mistakes I see people make is spending all of their
effort _planning_ for the worst, and only _hoping_ for the best. When you only
_hope_ for something, you aren't thinking through the details. You aren't asking
yourself, "What if I get it done in 2 days instead of 2 weeks?" or "What if
they actually say yes?" And then when something like that happens, you have no
plan, and the moment passes you by like a wave passing a surfer without their
board.

By planning _exclusively_ for the worst, we render ourselves unable to seize
those opportunities that could lead to the best---and then the worst just
happens by default.

I'm not saying we should _not_ plan for the worst. None of us has complete
control over our environment or the obstacles we will encounter. This is why we
should spend a portion of our energy preparing for those obstacles so that
we're ready to deal with them.

But sometimes the universe smiles upon you, and you find yourself on a
surprisingly smooth path. To spend _all_ of our energy planning for the worst
leaves nothing left to actually make plans for when things might go better than
expected: when solving a technical problem turns out to be _easier_ than we
thought, when we're able to complete our work _ahead_ of schedule, when all of
our dependencies actually fall into place (it can happen!), when our executive
leaders love what we're doing and want to give us more funding or support.

My point here is simple. Let's be done with "Hope for the best, plan for the
worst".

**Plan for the best**, _and_ plan for the worst.
