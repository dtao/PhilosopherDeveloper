One Friday night recently, some friends of mine dropped off their daughter for
an evening play date with three other girls. Their daughter hadn't met two of
the other girls, so they hoped she would get along with them but figured most
likely she would still want to come home before bedtime. When they returned
later that evening, the girls had become fast friends and were already making
plans for what they would do the next morning. But since the parents had
assumed their daughter would want to go home, they hadn't brought a change of
clothes, her toothbrush, or anything she would need for a sleepover; so they
found themselves driving home with a deeply disappointed and frustrated girl.

I've seen something similar happen too many times to count in the workplace. The
members of a product team will chat often about an idea: a vision, a strategy,
or just a cool feature they'd like to build. These discussions happen in bits
and pieces over Slack, during meetings on Zoom, in social gatherings---but
never on paper. No one ever takes the time to really put the idea "on paper" or
flesh out all the details, because "We'll never get time to work on that." And
then one day, some SVP or other senior leader comes along and asks, "Have we
ever thought about..." and the team has nothing to show. They assumed they
would never get the time of day from any senior leadership, and they were
unprepared when the moment came.

We've all heard the expression: _Hope for the best, plan for the worst._ It
sounds so sensible. And of course, it is coming from a very sensible place. We
should not simply hope that good things will happen and assume all of our dreams
will come true. Bad things do happen; challenges arise, and if we don't invest
any effort in preparing for them, then they can knock us down.

Here's another expression, slightly less famous, from Dwight D. Eisenhower:

> Plans are nothing; planning is everything.

The _existence_ of a plan is one thing. But it is really the _act_ of planning
that forces you to think through the details of what might happen and equips you
to handle different scenarios. This simple act makes a huge difference when
planning for different possible outcomes.

One of the most common mistakes I see people make is spending all of their
effort planning for the worst, and only _hoping_ for the best. When you only
_hope_ for something, it probably won't happen. By planning _exclusively_ for
the worst, we make it much more likely the worst will happen.

Sometimes, the universe smiles upon us, and an opportunity we never expected
comes along---and then we aren't ready for it, because we only planned for the
worst.

Of _course_ planning for the worst is important. I'm not saying we shouldn't do
it. But to spend _all_ of our energy planning for the worst leaves nothing left
to actually make plans for when things might go better than expected: when
solving a technical problem turns out to be _easier_ than we thought, when
we're able to complete our work _ahead_ of schedule, when all of our
dependencies magically click into place, when our executive leadership team
love what we're doing and want to give us more funding (and we don't even know
what to do with it).

My point here is simple. No more "Hope for the best, plan for the worst".

**Plan for the best, and plan for the worst.**
