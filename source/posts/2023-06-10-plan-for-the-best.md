- Our friends brought their daughter over to play with some other kids, planned
  to pick her up before bedtime assuming she would want to go home... then it
  turned out she wanted to sleep over, but they hadn't planned for that
- I've also seen this: a product team talks about an idea for a future vision,
  strategy, or even feature---in Slack, over Zoom, etc. many times, over many
  hours---but no one ever invests _dedicated_ time to putting the idea "on paper"
  and thinking it through, because "We'll never get time/investment to actually
  do it." And then one day, some SVP comes along and wonders about the product
  vision, wants to see what the team has been thinking about, and they have
  nothing to show. They assumed they'd never get the time of day from any exec
  leadership and so they didn't prepare anything for when the moment came.
- Saying we've all heard: "Hope for the best, plan for the worst"
- In the words of Dwight Eisenhower: "Plans are nothing ... Planning is everything"
- The existence of a plan is one thing; the act of planning forces you to think
  through the details of what will happen when
- One of the most common mistakes I see: we spend so much effort planning for
  the worst, we all but guarantee the worst will happen
- Meanwhile sometimes the universe smiles upon us and sends us an opportunity...
  and we aren't prepared for it
- Of course planning for the worst is important; we don't want to close our eyes
  to reality and find ourselves unprepared for hard times when they arrive. But
  to spend _all_ of our energy planning for the worst leaves nothing left to
  actually make plans for scenarios where dependencies _are_ met, where solving
  a problem was _easier_ than we expected, where we complete the work _ahead_ of
  schedule, where a stakeholder _loves_ our idea from the start, etc.
- So I believe in "Plan for the best, plan for the worst"
