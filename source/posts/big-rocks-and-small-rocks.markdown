# Outline

1. Sunday school lesson
2. Most of our processes: sprint planning, daily standups, etc. about working through small rocks
   a. Assumption is that all big rocks have been broken down, but this isn't always true
   b. And if it is, _should_ it be? Fundamentally a significant motivation for breaking things down is to be able to iterate and validate assumptions
   c. Iterating and validating is again often about finding the best small rocks, or determining what order to put the small rocks in
3. The big rocks are the ones that will make the difference, but they are also the ones that will be hardest to validate
4. It is very easy to fill all of your time with small rocks, which will mean seldom taking risks; but never taking risks is the biggest risk of all
