There is a lesson I learned in Sunday school that has stuck with me to this day. I recently became aware of the fact that I idly, almost subconsciously think about this lesson on a regular basis; and I've even started referencing it in conversations with colleagues. The basic idea is very simple, but it provides a useful metaphor that can help frame conversations around project management, prioritization, or even overall strategy.

My Sunday school teacher brought a big canister into the classroom along with two boxes of rocks. One of the boxes was full of large rocks, about the size of a fist. The other was filled with small pebbles.

"I want to fit all of these rocks into the jar," he said. "Let's see what happens if I put the small rocks in first." My teacher poured the pebbles into the canister, filling it about halfway. He then started placing the larger rocks into the canister, but only a few of them fit before there was no more room. "Hmm, that didn't work," he observed. "Maybe if we put the _big_ rocks in first?" He emptied the rocks from the canister back into their respective boxes. Then he put all of the larger rocks into the canister. Now they fit, and we could see that the little rocks would be able to fill the gaps between them. Sure enough, when the teacher poured the pebbles in they filled the remaining available space, and the canister was filled.

Our teacher explained that the rocks represented how we spent our time and attention. If you choose to spend your time and attention on little things first, you won't have enough left for the big rocks--the more important things in life.

When I stop and think about the rituals we perform on most of the software teams I've been a part of, they tend to be focused on the little rocks. Daily standups, sprints planning, estimation--they are all about making us better at selecting, sorting, and ultimately moving our small rocks into the canister. The rituals we have for big rocks are much less common and irregular: an ad hoc brainstorming session here, a roadmap review there. At least as measured by how we invest our time, our process feels a lot more optimized to move small rocks than big ones.

I think the idea is that our _projects_ are our big rocks, and the way we move them is by taking a hammer and breaking them up into little pieces so that we can then just move the little pieces. I won't claim that this doesn't make sense; a big factor in the rise of agile methodologies was the realization that treating projects as these huge, indivisible things that get delivered all-or-nothing--i.e. waterfall, i.e. the delivery of big rocks--created tons of risk. Breaking them up, delivering incrementally, and iterating are all tactics to mitigate that risk.

I wonder, though, if this trend has solved the right problem, or if it bought us more as an industry than it cost. Agile techniques improve a team's _operational_ effectiveness: they make us better at delivering the best versions of the projects we set out to tackle, as efficiently as we can. A big assumption is that we are working on the right projects to begin with. And how often do we ask ourselves that?

The trouble with breaking a big rock into little pieces is that it's like Humpty Dumpty: you can't put it back together again. Once we've made the backlog, and started the first sprint, the questions we'll be asking ourselves for the next few months will always have to do with which little rocks we're working on next. We've lost sight of the big rock we started with.
