_Note: this is a **very** old post from my old Wordpress blog. Occasionally I
will go back and publish old posts out of historical interest._

Read [this Snopes article](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-unsolvable-math-problem/) and tell me you don’t want to be [George Dantzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dantzig).

In case you don’t feel like reading the whole article, the gist of it is this: a graduate math student wandered into class late one day, noted a couple of math problems written on the board, mistook them for homework, solved one of them and turned it in a few days “late” with apologies to the professor. Six weeks later his professor came knocking on his door to inform him that he had solved an unsolved math problem (the problems on the board had not been homework) and that he wanted to publish the student’s homework as a research paper.

Seriously, this story suggests to me that all teachers should pose unsolved problems to their students without revealing that the problems are unsolved on a regular basis. I wonder how often something like this could happen?
