- I wrote "Advice vs guidelines" because I wanted to be clear about when my
  intent is to be helpful vs. prescriptive
- But I've noticed there's another distinction that needs to be made, because
  as someone who writes for a general audience sometimes I get reactions that
  help me to realize my advice isn't always as universal as I may think
- In truth, I don't think there is any universally applicable advice: we all
  come from different backgrounds, face different challenges, are the result of
  a unique combination of countless variables that collectively made us who and
  what we are
- Sometimes, what YOU need to hear is "Stop questioning yourself so much and
  just go for it"... other people may need to hear the opposite: "Look before
  you leap"
- Some might need to hear "A penny saved is a penny earned"... others may need
  to hear "Carpe diem"
- Some might need to hear "The squeaky wheel gets the grease"... others may need
  to hear the story of the boy who cried wolf
- I have to remind myself of this sometimes, when I hear advice that doesn't
  resonate for me: "Maybe this just isn't what _I_ need to hear." That doesn't
  mean it's wrong.
- Let others hear what they need to hear, and keep your ears open for the wisdom
  that's meant for you.
