We're so divided. How do we become more united?

Many are urging us to put hate aside, to embrace love. This sounds great but I am skeptical that this message carries much force. Encouraging individuals to alter their behavior will have an effect on maybe 1% of the population if we're lucky, the same way appealing to people's compassion will illicit a charitable donation here and there but not result in any large-scale change.

You cannot start with feelings. Feelings are a downstream result of experiences. Telling people to feel or act a certain way is therefore backwards. Change their experiences and feelings will follow.

What are these experiences? On the conservative side I can think of a few. The first, the one everyone's talking about, is the deteriorating quality of life for working class whites in rural America. In grossly oversimplified terms this group has seen their men losing their jobs while other groups, from racial minorities to foreigners to LGBTs, seem to be getting special attention from the establishment. This breeds resentment of both those groups and the establishment.

Another one is the sorrow of evangelicals who feel that the country is sinking further into secularism, in many ways but probably most notably in our culture's growing acceptance of abortion as a legal option for pregnant women. This group sees the imminent appointment of Supreme Court justices who would continue to cultivate this growth--or rather, the appointment that *would have been* imminent had a Democrat been elected--as nothing short of catastrophic. Voting against this development was for this group a solemn duty.

A third experience relates to the working class as well: the growing fear and disrespect towards law enforcement, fueled by the liberal media. Many people are seeing the career of their father, brother, uncle, etc.--not exactly prestigious but perfectly respectable and valued--under attack.
