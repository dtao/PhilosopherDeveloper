Throughout my career the question of "quality vs. speed" has always been
a topic of spirited debate. The premise is that these are competing
values, with some people, teams, or companies focused more on quality
while others focus more on speed. It is almost like there is an implied
spectrum, with quality on one side and speed on the other, so that you
could assign every individual or team a "quality vs. speed score" from
0 to 100 to define where they fall on the spectrum, describing their
relative attention to building high-quality things and moving fast.

# The wrong question

My view is that the "quality vs. speed" question is poorly formed
because it has a false premise. If there really were a spectrum, and if
either quality or speed were in fact "more important", then one end of
the spectrum ought to be "better" than the other. So let's consider the
two ends.

Someone on the "quality" end of the spectrum would optimize for **value
per change**: for every deliverable they produce, it should provide the
highest possible value. "Do the best possible version." "Anything worth
doing is worth doing right." Etc. This approach is known as
perfectionism.

![To a perfectionist mindset, all that matters is average quality](/images/perfectionism.png)

The problem with perfectionism is that it does not include the crucial
variable of time. It makes a big difference whether the "best possible
version" takes 2 hours to make, or 2 weeks, or 2 years. It also
neglects to consider the surrounding context: if I'm a professional
chef, I might want the best possible cookware, but not care as much
about my shoes. If I'm a professional athlete, the opposite could be
true.

I believe that optimizing for value-per-change comes from what most of
us experienced during school. In school, the number of challenges we
are given is fixed, and the best possible outcome results from
completing all of those challenges as well as possible. The real world
is not like this: we are not all given the same assignments. The best
outcome for you is often not to deliver the A+ version of everything
someone else gives you to do; often, the best outcome requires far more
proactiveness---delivering more than strictly what was asked---and a
willingness to iterate.

Someone on the "speed" end of the spectrum would optimize for **change
over time**. Do things as fast as possible, then move on to the next
thing. You might also call this "quantity over quality".

![To a "quantity over quality" mindset, average quality doesn't matter](/images/quantity-over-quality.png)

In contrast to perfectionism, which leaves out the variable of time, the
speed-over-everything mindset leaves out the variable of quality, or
value. If you can deliver 100 new products in a year, but they're all
basically worthless, is that truly better than delivering nothing?

So if we only cared about quality, then we would say that whether you
complete 1 project in a year, or 5, or 20, it makes no difference: all
that matters is the average quality of them.

Meanwhile, if we only cared about speed, then we would say that whether
the projects you complete in a year are F- quality, or C+ quality, or A+
quality on average, that doesn't matter: what's important is simply the
number of projects you complete.

If we plot what these two approaches would look like over time, we would
see something like this:

# The right question

Rather than value-per-change, or change-over-time, I believe the right
thing to optimize for is **value over time**. It is not that quality
matters more than speed, or that speed matters more than quality, in any
objective sense. What we are ultimately striving to do is to use the
finite time we have to provide the greatest value within that time.

Remember [bivariate optimization][1] in math? This is where, say, you
have 100 ft of fence and you need to enclose the largest possible
rectangular area. Doing this requires solving for two variables (in this
case, length and width) to maximize their product (area) with the
constraint that they must add up to 100 ft.

You could "optimize for length", making the enclosure 48 ft long and
only 1 ft wide. Or you could "optimize for width" and make it 48 ft wide
and only 1 ft long.

![Two very bad solutions to bivariate optimization](/images/length-vs-width.png)

Both of these approaches are clearly wrong: we can see that it isn't
true that "length is more important than width" or vice versa. The
thing we want to optimize for---the area---is a function of both of
those factors. They need to play together.

I believe quality vs. speed is a false dichotomy. It is like asking
about "length vs. width", pitting two dimensions against each other
when what we actually care about requires both. Reimaginging the same
spectrum I shared earlier with the two ends relabeled, it suddenly looks
very silly.

So why does it sometimes probably feel to my teams like I only care
about speed (or maybe your local leadership team is the opposite, and
they seem to only care about quality)? Well, one possible explanation
is that I'm just wrong. But another possibility is that speed or
quality actually _can_ be "more important", not objectively, but
relative to the current state of things.

# Getting the car where it needs to go

Here's an analogy I've shared in the past: imagine you and your team are
driving a car through open wilderness, towards some important
destination.

Suppose you and your team members get in the car, check your
instruments, validate you're headed the right way, then drive 10 ft.
forward. You stop, check your instruments again, validate again, and
drive another 10 ft. And so on.

In this scenario, your group is focusing _too much_ on heading the right
direction, and not enough on getting there faster. To them, as an
advisor, I might say: "Stop getting out of the car so much and just GO."

Or suppose your team gets in the car, figures out what direction you
want to go, and then just _floor_ it, racing for hours without
stopping.

In this scenario your group is too focused on moving fast. You could be
veering wildly off course, even heading 180 degrees the wrong way. If I
were advising them I would say: "Whoa there, you're going the wrong way.
Pause and check your instruments. Stop and check every now and then."

If we have a destination, we need to know both: (a) are we heading the
right way, and (b) how fast are we moving. If we just know we're
heading the right way, but we're only moving 2mph, it's going to take
us a long time to get there---possibly so long that the destination
won't even be worth reaching by the time we get there. Meanwhile, if
we're moving 100mph, but heading the completely wrong direction, that
doesn't do us any good either.

Clearly the "right" way to drive the car involves a balance between
paying attention to where you're going while also moving as fast as
possible. In practice, most teams are often too focused on one or the
other.

# Why speed gets all the love

As I've written before, it is very common that [different people need
to hear different things][2].

If my teams feel like I'm always telling them to "move faster", it
doesn't mean "speed is more important than quality"; it means I believe
their balance is off and there's a better way to get to the destination.

A lot of intelligent, hard-working people prioritize quality over speed
by default because they don't consider the time dimension. Again, I
blame the wrong lessons learned during school for this mindset, as
every student in a class is forced to the same schedule (all take a
quiz or a test on the same day, assignments are due the same day for
everyone) so that time is fixed and quality is the only variable. In an
academic setting, there is generally no bonus for completing
assignments early, or for completing 2x the assignments of your peers.
Sadly, the people who _most_ need to unlearn this lesson are the A
students! They are the ones who "won" in school by focusing solely on
quality (i.e. getting the best possible grade).

The other thing is that I know we all want to put our best foot forward,
which sometimes means planning to put our work in customers' hands when
it's mostly "done", i.e. let's say 90% done. Sometimes I ask if we can
ship something sooner, not necessarily because I want the overall
project timeline to be shortened, but because I believe the end result
will be higher-quality if we start getting feedback from customers much
earlier in the process, giving us more time to incorporate that feedback
into our work.

There is no set formula here. You could be Harper Lee and create [one
incredible masterpiece][3], win the Pulitzer Prize, and have greater
impact than most of us would have in 10 lifetimes. You could also
hustle your whole life, build 100 companies, and ultimately fail to
leave a mark.

What we all have in common is that our time is always limited---the time
we work on a project, the time we're together as a team, the time we
work for a company, the time we're here on this Earth---and in the end
we want to make the most of it.
