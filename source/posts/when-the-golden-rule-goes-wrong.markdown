title: When the golden rule goes wrong

One of my friends from Philadelphia[^philadelphia] once told me about a time
he went on a trip with mostly guys he didn't know (I think it was for a
bachelor party or something). Most members of the group were from the midwest
or maybe the south[^maybe-the-south]. At first everything was fine, but as the
trip went on, he started to feel uneasy. Eventually he realized that it was
making him uncomfortable how *nice* everyone was being to each other.

For my friend and his regular social group, normal behavior is just constantly
tearing each other to pieces. You make fun of each other, mock everything your
friend says or does, at every opportunity. I'm sure this sounds incredibly
unpleasant to many people, but for my friend and his group it's what puts
everyone at ease. No one is exempt, but no one is singled out.

This is why my friend wasn't comfortable in this new group of polite
strangers. He was suspicious of their kindness and kept bracing for the
sarcasm. He had trouble letting his guard down.

At Atlassian there is a company culture of giving "kudos", which is a material
way of recognizing a coworker for going above and beyond by giving them a gift
card or donating to a charity on their behalf. It's a way to reinforce
positivity throughout the company, by empowering employees to reward each
other's hard work.

Now here's my problem: I completely relate to the way my friend felt on that
trip. When someone gives me a compliment, my natural knee-jerk reaction is to
deflect it somehow. I may consciously understand that the compliment is
sincere, but I still unconsciously brace for sarcasm. This is especially true
in situations where I don't personally feel what I did was anything noteworthy
or special.

So for *me*, the idea of receiving a kudos actually makes me a little
uncomfortable, just as my friend was uncomfortable in a group of friends being
nice to each other. Those who have given me compliments over the years may
have noticed this as I often respond sarcastically, e.g. "Yeah, I'm pretty
much a hero."

We're all familiar with the so-called Golden Rule: treat others the way *you*
would want to be treated.

This rule makes a ton of sense. But as a manager, and as a person who is
naturally sarcastic and guarded, it poses a problem. One of the biggest ways
that I have let my team down over the past few years is by not making enough
of a point to recognize great work as often as I should. This applies to giving
kudos[^doing-your-job], but it also manifests in a hundred different little
missed opportunities, from writing more to praising team members more publicly
for good work to simply saying, "Hey, great job."

[^philadelphia]: This may seem like an irrelevant detail, but I don't think it
is. This is the town where football fans [booed and threw snowballs at Santa
Claus][1]. It really shouldn't be called the City of Brotherly Love.

[^maybe-the-south]: It doesn't really matter. They just definitely *weren't*
from Philadelphia.

[^doing-your-job]: I even sometimes joke with one of the other team leads on
Bitbucket about giving out "Doing your job" stickers instead of kudos. We
should probably stop making that joke.
