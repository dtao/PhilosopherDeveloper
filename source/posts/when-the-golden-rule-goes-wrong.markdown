title: When the golden rule goes wrong

I'm from Philadelphia. There's an anecdote I like to tell sometimes to encapsulate what I think of
as "Philly" culture. It isn't even my own story, but whatever.

My friend told me about a time he went on a trip with some guys he didn't know for a bachelor party.
Most of the guys in the group were from the midwest or the south or something. (It doesn't really
matter. They just definitely *weren't* from Philadelphia.) The way he tells it, as the trip went
on, he became more and more uncomfortable with how nice everyone was being to each other.

Here's the context: for a group of young adult males in Philadelphia, normal behavior is just
constantly tearing each other to pieces. You make fun of each other, mock everything your friend
says or does, repeatedly. In a strange way, it makes everyone feel good because nothing is sacred
and no one is immune.

So you can understand how my friend wasn't comfortable in this new group of polite midwesternites.
I remember him saying, "They were, like, *complimenting* each other on stuff." The horror!

We're all familiar with the so-called Golden Rule: treat others the way *you* would want to be
treated.

I've been thinking about this rule a lot lately. For the most part, most of the time, it makes 
ton of sense. But recently, on my team, it has come to light that there might be times when the
golden rule isn't exactly perfect.

I'll give you an example. At Atlassian there is a company culture of giving "kudos", which is a
material way of recognizing a coworker for going above and beyond by giving them a $25 gift card.
It's a way to reinforce positivity throughout the company, by empowering employees to recognize
each other's hard work.

Sound familiar? Like I said, I'm from Philly. That story about my friend: I completely relate to
that. When someone gives me a compliment, my natural knee-jerk reaction is to deflect it somehow.
I may actually turn it around and tease the person for giving me the compliment! This is especially
true for situations when I don't personally feel what I did was anything special.

So for *me*, the idea of receiving a kudos actually makes me a little uncomfortable, just as my
friend was uncomfortable seeing a group of friends give compliments to each other. Those who have
given me compliments over the years may have noticed this as I often respond sarcastically, e.g.
"Yeah, I'm pretty much a hero." (Lately I have at least become self-aware enough that I try to at
least manage a polite "Thanks!")

I am a firm believer in the golden rule. But as you can probably see, now, this is actually
problematic. One of the biggest ways that I have let my team down over the past several years is by
not making enough of a point to recognize great work as often as I should. One of the other team
leads on Bitbucket and I even sometimes joke about giving out "Doing your job" stickers instead of
kudos. In our own sad way, we're applying the golden rule.
