title: When the golden rule goes wrong

One of my friends from Philadelphia[^philadelphia] once told me about a time
he went on a trip -- I think it was a bachelor party or something -- with
mostly guys he didn't know. Most members of the group were from the midwest or
maybe the south[^maybe-the-south]. At first everything was fine, but as the
trip went on, he started to feel uneasy. Eventually he realized that it was
making him uncomfortable how *nice* everyone was being to each other.

For my friend and his regular social group, normal behavior was just constantly
tearing each other to pieces. They would make fun of each other, mocking just
about everything anyone said or did that was remotely genuine, at every
opportunity. I'm sure this sounds unpleasant to most people, but for my friend
and his group it's what put everybody at ease. No one was exempt, which meant
that no one was singled out.

This is why my friend wasn't comfortable in this new group of polite
strangers. He was suspicious of their kindness and kept bracing for the
sarcasm. He had trouble letting his guard down.

At Atlassian there is a company culture of giving "kudos", which is a material
way of recognizing a coworker for going above and beyond by giving them a gift
card or donating to a charity on their behalf. It's a way to reinforce
positivity throughout the company, empowering employees to reward each other's
hard work.

Here's my problem: I completely relate to the way my friend felt on that trip
with the polite crowd. When someone gives me a compliment, my natural knee-jerk
reaction is to deflect it somehow. I may consciously understand that the
compliment is sincere, but I still unconsciously brace for a sucker punch. This
is especially true in situations where I don't personally feel that what I did
was anything noteworthy or special.

So for *me*, the idea of receiving a kudos actually makes me a little
uncomfortable, just as my friend was uncomfortable in a group of friends being
nice to each other. Those who have given me compliments over the years may
have noticed this. I often respond dismissively in an attempt to be
self-deprecating, e.g. "Yeah, I'm pretty much a hero."

We're all familiar with the so-called [Golden Rule][1]: treat others the way
*you* would want to be treated.

This rule makes a ton of sense. But as a manager, and as someone with a
proclivity for being cynical, it poses a problem. One of the biggest ways that
I have let my team down over the past few years is by not making enough of a
point to recognize great work as often as I should. This applies to giving
kudos[^doing-your-job], but it manifests in a hundred other little missed
opportunities as well: from writing more blog posts about my team's wins, to
praising team members publicly for good work, to simply giving someone a high
five or pulling them aside to say, "Hey, great job."

On reflection, I've realized that I have unconsciously projected my own
discomfort with receiving praise onto my team in an unfortunate distortion of
the golden rule. Because *I* feel awkward with praise, I have been stingy in
giving out praise to others. This has certainly not been deliberate -- I have
always had the _intention_ of providing lots of positive feedback -- but that
hasn't made it any less true.

I call this a distortion of the golden rule because, at the risk of stating the
obvious, the golden rule isn't about saddling others with your own weird
hangups. It's also not "Treat others the way that would make you feel the least
awkward." The rule is to treat others the way you would *want* to be treated.

And If I'm honest with myself, I _do_ want to receive praise. Not to stoke my
ego (though that's always nice), but because I want to grow. And growing
requires for me to be challenged, and to know when I've met those challenges.

I think we all want positive feedback in some form, whether it's verbal praise,
a solid performance review, or an [audible clicking sound][2]. I may feel
_uncomfortable_ with it, but I still want and even need it, for the same
reasons that I want and need to be challenged. They are both part of my own
personal growth.

And so for me as a manager, applying the golden rule doesn't mean avoiding
anything that could make my team feel awkward[^awkward]. It certainly doesn't
mean withholding praise. It means challenging them, and letting them and
everyone else know when they've met those challenges, whether they like it or
not.

When I first interviewed for the job on Bitbucket, the GM for the Developer
Tools division at the time described Atlassian to me as a company of "humble
over-achievers". It is a description that has stuck with me. The team is mostly
different people today, but I feel it still captures the spirit of what makes
Atlassian as a whole and Bitbucket in particular special. My job is to make the
over-achievers a _little bit_ less humble.

So yeah, basically... I'm going to start giving more kudos.

[^philadelphia]: This may seem like an irrelevant detail, but I don't think it is. This is the town where football fans [booed and threw snowballs at Santa Claus][3]. It really shouldn't be called the City of Brotherly Love.

[^maybe-the-south]: It doesn't really matter. They just definitely *weren't* from Philadelphia.

[^doing-your-job]: I even sometimes joke with one of the other team leads on Bitbucket about giving out "Doing your job" stickers instead of kudos. We should probably stop making that joke.

[^awkward]: And trust me, there are plenty of devs on my team who do the same thing I do and deflect compliments and downplay their own accomplishments.
