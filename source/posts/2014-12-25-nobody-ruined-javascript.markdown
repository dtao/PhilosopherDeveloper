Well, it's been a while since I've written anything here. Over six months! Almost hard to believe.

It's funny: looking back, I find that the longer my career goes on, the more experienced I become, the less I think I have anything really important to say. This feels a bit like a universal law to me, a paradox of sorts: the less experience you have, the more deluded you are about how valuable your experience is. With wisdom comes humility, I guess. Or maybe I'm confusing humility with pessimism?

Anyway, this is sort of a response to [You have ruined JavaScript](http://codeofrob.com/entries/you-have-ruined-javascript.html) by Rob Ashton. To be honest, I like Rob's article. I even agree in spirit with a lot of his points, even if I am in many ways the sort of person he's attacking. Regardless, I'm just going to go ahead and say it: nobody ruined JavaScript. Nobody ruined anything. Everything's fine.

Let me start with a personal story. For a while now I've been loosely following the development of ES6. To be frank, there are things that bug me about ES6. There are lots of what I'd call "library-grade" features being added to the language: features which could easily be (and have been) implemented by open-source libraries, without language-level support. Sets, maps, new array/string methods, and classes all fall under this description. There are also features that just feel unnecessary to me, such as the `let` keyword.

I could go into detail about *why* I feel this way, but I'm sure others already have. I'd just be throwing my voice onto a big pile of noise. At best I'd raise one or two novel points that nobody else had made. But I recognize that there are decent arguments on both sides. More importantly, there's a whole group of people who care a *lot* about this, and they've been taking the time to actually have civilized discussions about it and debate what should go into the standard. And let me tell you something: when you're working on something, trying to make it better, there's nothing quite as irritating as someone coming along, who hasn't been participating at all, telling you everything they think is wrong about what you've been doing.

What I ultimately realized? Doesn't matter. ES6 is coming along, and I can use some of its shiny new features, but I don't have to if I don't want to. Truth is, I probably will use even those features I don't agree with, because they're there, and they're convenient.

But back to Rob Ashton and cracking up at the Angular docs. Firstly, I'll just toss out the surface-level defense that those ServiceProviderFactoryFactory examples look nothing like any Angular code I've ever seen. Angular is fundamentally an upgrade to what you can achieve with HTML. It's way to design a UI in HTML, with some special attributes, plus just a sprinkling of JavaScript, and get something really powerful in very *little* code. That's the bones of Angular. All the "framework" stuff that's evolved since Angular's inception is kinda on top of that. Just like ES6 piles a ton of functionality onto the plain ol' "objects and functions" flavor of JavaScript I know and love.

Beyond defending Angular, though, here's my higher-than-surface-level response: who cares?

Nobody ruined anything.
