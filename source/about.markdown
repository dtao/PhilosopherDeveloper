I'm a software developer currently residing in San Francisco. I work at [Google](http://www.google.com/about/jobs/) on the Ads Review team. Previously I worked at [Cardpool](http://www.cardpool.com/), and before that [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) (and before *that*, an algorithmic trading company in Philadelphia that no one's ever heard of).

I studied philosophy at Duke University, then a couple of years later went to [Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/) for a graduate degree in software engineering (hence the name of this blog). In between I lived with my wife in Namibia for a year through [WorldTeach](http://www.worldteach.org/), an organization that places volunteer teachers in developing countries around the world.

A disclaimer about my writing. I try to be humble, but I also form a lot of opinions over the course of my (thus far, pretty short) career. So I often write about how I think software should be developed, or how teams or even companies (especially tech companies) should operate. Bear in mind that I've never run my own company. It's possible that I might like to some day; but I would never want to run a business just for the sake of running a business, so it's also possible that I might not.

One principle I believe in quite strongly is that there's really no place for arrogance in this world. Living in Silicon Valley, I can't help but feel that most of us in this industry are encouraged to forget that. The culture here is one seemingly designed to inflate egos and reward self-importance. Having said that, I realize that I'm guilty of it from time to time as well. So let this page serve as my perpetual apology for ever letting my head get too big, or acting like I know what I'm talking about.
