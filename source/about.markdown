I was born and raised in a suburb of Philadelphia. After high school, I studied
philosophy at Duke University, then a couple of years later went to [Carnegie
Mellon Silicon Valley][6] for a graduate degree in software engineering. In
between I lived with my wife in Namibia for a year working for [WorldTeach][7],
an organization that places volunteer teachers in developing countries around
the world.

After grad school I lived with my wife in San Francisco for almost 5 years. Our
daughter was born there. In 2015, we moved to Austin, Texas, where we still
live now with our three children.

My experience runs the gamut from algorithmic trading in Philadelphia to
software consulting at [ThoughtWorks][3], to a startup called [Cardpool][4], to
[Google][5] on the Ads Review team. Currently I'm the head of engineering for
[Bibucket Cloud][1] at [Atlassian][2].

If you look back on [the history][8] of this blog, you can see that my output
has diminished over time. I like to think that I'll be able to turn that
around and get back to writing more frequently. Writing is definitely something
I enjoy.

Like everyone else, I'm still figuring things out.
