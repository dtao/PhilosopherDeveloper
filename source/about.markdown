I was born and raised in a suburb of Philadelphia, lived in San Francisco for almost 5 years, and moved to Austin with my family in 2015.

Currently I'm leading the [Bibucket][1] engineering team in Austin for [Atlassian][2]. My previous experience runs the gamut from consulting at [ThoughtWorks][3] to a startup called [Cardpool][4] to [Google][5] on the Ads Review team.

I studied philosophy at Duke University, then a couple of years later went to [Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley][6] for a graduate degree in software engineering. In between I lived with my wife in Namibia for a year working for [WorldTeach][7], an organization that places volunteer teachers in developing countries around the world.

Strangely I've found that the more experienced I become, the less I seem motivated to write in this blog. It's a bit of a paradox: with more experience, I *should* have more of value to share, yet that same experience makes me more skeptical that anything I have to say is really worth sharing.

I suppose, like everybody else, I'm still figuring stuff out.
