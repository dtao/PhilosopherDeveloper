This is the repo for my blog, [The Philosopher Developer](http://philosopherdeveloper.com/).

The site is developed using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). I use [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) for comments and [ShareThis](http://www.sharethis.com/) for the social sharing buttons (Twitter, etc.) on each post. (Incidentally, if you know of a better sharing product, [let me know](https://github.com/dtao/PhilosopherDeveloper/issues)! I'm really not a huge fan of ShareThis, mainly because I feel like it slows down page loads significantly. But I'm also too lazy to fiddle with those buttons myself.)

The content of the posts themselves is all in **source/posts**. Each post is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and rendered using [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) and [Rouge](https://github.com/jayferd/rouge) for syntax highlighting via the [middleman-syntax](https://github.com/middleman/middleman-syntax) gem.

Mostly, I keep the blog focused on higher-level discussions about software and/or philosophy, though a lot of my earlier posts were much more technical. I also have a website at [danieltao.com](http://danieltao.com/) with other random thoughts, ideas, and opinions.

Follow [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dan_tao) or subscribe to [the RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/philosopherdeveloper) if you want updates whenever I write a new post.

I think that about covers it.
