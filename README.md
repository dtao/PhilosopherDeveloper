This is the repo for my blog, [The Philosopher Developer][1].

The site is developed using [Middleman][2] and is hosted on [GitHub Pages][3]. I use [Disqus][4] for
comments and [ShareThis][5] for the social sharing buttons (Twitter, etc.) on each post.
(Incidentally, if you know of a better sharing product, [let me know][6]! I'm really not a huge fan
of ShareThis, mainly because I feel like it slows down page loads significantly. But I'm also too
lazy to fiddle with those buttons myself.)

The content of the posts themselves is all in **source/posts**. Each post is written in
[Markdown][7] and rendered using [Redcarpet][8] and [Rouge][9] for syntax highlighting via the
[middleman-syntax][10] gem.

Mostly, I keep the blog focused on higher-level discussions about software and/or philosophy, though
a lot of my earlier posts were much more technical. I also have a website at [danieltao.com][11]
with other random thoughts, ideas, and opinions.

Follow [me on Twitter][12] or subscribe to [the RSS feed][13] if you want updates whenever I write a
new post.

I think that about covers it.
